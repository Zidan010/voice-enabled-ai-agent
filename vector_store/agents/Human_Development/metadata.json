inequalities that have weighed heavily\nthroughout the pandemic.\n\nIndeed, those inequalities\nhave helped fuel its spread.\n\nThe groups most likely to\nbe left behind have borne the brunt of its health and\neconomic risks.\n\nWomen and girls have shouldered\neven more household and caregiving responsibilities,\nwhile violence against them has worsened (see chap ter in the full Report).11 Pre-existing digital divides\nhave widened gaps in children’s education access and\nquality.12 Some fear a “lost generation” of learners.13\nFor people everywhere the Covid-19 pandemic\nhas generated questions without easy answers, fore most among them: When is this “over”?\n\nAnswers\nhave proved fleeting, often dashed by upticks in cases\nor the setting of new restrictions, forcing us back to\nsquare one.\n\nGlobal supply chains remain stubborn ly knotted, contributing to inflation in all countries\n— and in some, at rates not seen in decades.14 The\nimplications of unprecedented monetary and fiscal\ninterventions aiming to rescue ravaged economies,\nmany still scarred by the global financial crisis, re main largely uncertain.\n\nThey unspool before us in\nreal time and alongside resurgent geopolitical ten sions.\n\nThe pandemic is more than a virus, and it sim ply is not “over.”\nWith successive waves that have caught countries\nflat-footed time and time again, ongoing mutability\nand the seesawing of lockdowns, the Covid-19 pan demic and its seemingly endless twists and turns\nhave — perhaps above all else — entrenched a climate\nof dogged uncertainty and unsettledness.\n\nAnd this\nis just one pandemic, having emerged seemingly out\nof nowhere, like a phantom that cannot be exorcised.\n\nWe were long warned about the threat of novel res piratory pathogens.15 As we move deeper into the An thropocene, we have been warned that there will be\nmore.\n\nA new uncertainty complex is emerging\nThe impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on economies\npale beside the upheavals expected by powerful new\ntechnologies and the hazards and transformations\nthey pose.\n\nWhat do investments in people’s education\nand skills — a key part of human development — look like in the face of the disorienting pace of techno logical change, including automation and artificial\nintelligence?\n\nOr in the face of deliberate, necessary\nenergy transitions that would restructure societies?\n\nMore broadly, amid unprecedented patterns of dan gerous planetary change, what capabilities matter\nand how?\n\n“ The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic\non economies pale beside the upheavals\nexpected by powerful new technologies and\nthe hazards and transformations they pose\nRecent years have seen more record temperatures,\nfires and storms around the world, alarming remind ers that the climate crisis marches on, alongside other\nplanetary-level changes wrought by the Anthropo cene.\n\nBiodiversity collapse is one of them.\n\nMore\nthan million plant and animal species face extinc tion.16 As much as the Covid-19 pandemic caught us\nby surprise, unprepared and fumbling for paths for ward, we have even less of an idea of how to live in a\nworld without, say, an abundance of insects.\n\nThat has\nnot been tried for about million years, when the\nworld’s first land plants appeared.\n\nThis is not a coin cidence.\n\nWithout an abundance of insect pollinators,\nwe face the mindboggling challenge of growing food\nand other agricultural products at scale.\n\nHuman societies and ecological systems have long\ninfluenced — and surprised — one another, but not\nat the scales and speeds of the Anthropocene.\n\nHu mans are now shaping planetary trajectories,17 and\nthe dramatically changing baselines — from global\ntemperatures to species diversity — are altering the\nfundamental frame of reference humans have been\noperating under for millennia.\n\nIt is as if the ground\nbeneath our feet is shifting, introducing a new kind of\nplanetary uncertainty for which we have no real guide.\n\nMaterial cycles, for example, have been upended.\n\nFor the first time in history, humanmade materials,\nsuch as concrete and asphalt, outweigh the Earth’s\nbiomass.\n\nMicroplastics are now everywhere: in coun try-sized garbage patches in the ocean, in protect ed forests and distant mountaintops and in people’s\nlungs and blood.18 Mass coral bleaching is now com monplace rather than extraordinary.19\nThe latest International Panel on Climate Change\nReport is a “code red for humanity.”20 While we still\nhave the possibility to prevent excessive global warm ing and avoid the worst scenarios, human-induced\nchanges to our planetary system are expected to con tinue well into the future.\n\nIn essence, as science has\nadvanced, the models are, with better precision than\nbefore, predicting more volatility.21\nAny one of the rapid, planetary-level, human-in duced changes of the Anthropocene would be enough\non its own to inject frightening new uncertainties into\nthe fate of not just individuals, communities or even\nnations, but of all humankind.\n\nRecall just a few dec ades ago when chlorofluorocarbons entered global\nconsciousness.\n\nOr the insecticide known as DDT be fore that.\n\nOr nuclear proliferation before that (and,\nsadly, still today).\n\nThe human-induced forces at work\nin the Anthropocene are not atomized or neatly se quenced.\n\nThey are not islands of perturbations in a\nsea of relative stability.\n\nInstead, they are stacked on\ntop of each other, interacting and amplifying in un predictable ways.",

they can\nbe propagated in systems rather than stabilized by\nthem.\n\nHuman pulsing of natural systems at unprecedent ed intensities and scales is one side of the uncertainty\ncoin.\n\nOn the other are stubborn social deficits, in cluding deficits in human development, which make\nit more difficult to navigate unpredictable outcomes\nand to dial down those pulses in the first place.\n\nCon sider the Covid-19 pandemic, which has as much to\ndo with inequalities, poor leadership and distrust as\nit does with variants and vaccines.\n\nOr competition\nfor environmental resources, competition that does\nnot typically break down into conflict.\n\nWhile stressed\necosystems can parallel grievances, grievances be come conflicts due to social imbalances.25 Political\npower, inequalities and marginalization contribute\nmore to environmental conflict than does access to\nnatural resources.\n\nPolitical polarization complicates matters further\n(figure 4).\n\nIt has been on the rise, and uncertainty\nmakes it worse and is worsened by it (see chapter\nin the full Report).\n\nLarge numbers of people feel frus trated by and alienated from their political systems.26\nIn a reversal from just years ago, democratic back sliding is now the prevailing trend across countries.27\nThis despite high support globally for democracy.\n\nArmed conflicts are also up, including outside socalled fragile contexts.28 For the first time ever, more\nthan million people are forcibly displaced, most\nof them within their own countries.29\nThe conjunction of uncertainty and polarization\nmay be paralyzing — delaying action to curb human\npressures on the planet.\n\nThe real paradox of our time\nmay be our inability to act, despite mounting evi dence of the distress that human planetary pressures\nare causing ecological and social systems.\n\nUnless we\nget a handle on the worrying state of human affairs,\nwe face the Anthropocene’s vicissitudes with one\nhand tied behind our backs.\n\nEven when functioning properly, conventional\ncrisis response and risk management mechanisms,\nsuch as various forms of insurance, are not up to the\ntask of global, interconnected disruption.\n\nThe unco ordinated responses to the Covid-19 pandemic are\na case in point.\n\nNew strategies are needed for tail\nevents synchronized at the global level.\n\nAddressing\nrisk through diversification is difficult when volatili ty affects the entire system rather than only parts of\nit.\n\nYet, numerous countries around the world have\nbeen steadily chipping away at risk sharing in many\nways.30 New forms of work and their uncertainties\nhave become more important in technology-enabled\ngig economies.\n\nAltogether, insecurity has long been\non the rise.\n\nAnd it has been on the rise for some groups more\nthan others.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of novel, interacting\nuncertainties, people with power, wealth or privilege\nhave the means, to some degree, to protect them selves privately and to shift more of the burden on to\nothers.\n\nThe groups most likely to be left behind face a world with complex new uncertainties in which most\nof those uncertainties are directed at them, heaped\non persistent discrimination and human rights viola tions.31 It is not just that typhoons are getting bigger\nand deadlier through human impact on the environ ment;

or\notherwise.\n\nMental distress, whose prevention is a critical aspect of overall mental wellbeing, is aggra vated by uncertainties and insecurities of all stripes:\nby major Anthropocene phenomena, such as climate\nchange; by age-old scourges of discrimination, exclu sion, conflict and violence; and by relatively newer\nentrants, such as social media and other technologies.\n\nThe uncertainties of the Anthropocene are expect ed to undermine people’s mental wellbeing through\nfour main pathways: traumatizing events, physical\nillness, general climate anxiety and food insecurity\n(see chapter in the full Report).\n\nThe effects these\nand other pathways have on children in particular\nare profound, altering brain and body development,\nespecially in families on lower social rungs, poten tially diminishing what children can achieve in life.\n\nThe 2019 Human Development Report explored how\ninequalities in human development are perpetuated\nacross generations;41 it is not difficult to see how the\nconfluence of mental distress, inequality and inse curity foment a similarly injurious intergenerational\ncycle that drags on human development.\n\n“ The uncertainties of the Anthropocene\nare expected to undermine people’s mental\nwellbeing through four main pathways:\ntraumatizing events, physical illness, general\nclimate anxiety and food insecurity\nViolence — even the threat of violence, its\nuncertainty — is a major driver of mental distress.\n\nSome survivors of and witnesses to violence suffer\ntrauma, which if not addressed properly can devel op into post-traumatic stress disorder, among other\nchronic health conditions, that can weigh heavily on\nthe choices available to them.\n\nViolence may be di rected at one person or group of people, but it affects\neverybody in its blast radius.\n\nEven perpetrators of\nviolence can suffer trauma due to the violent setting\nthat often surrounds them, as with organized crime\nor gang violence.42\nThe losses exacted by violence extend well beyond\ndirect physical, mental and emotional injury or trau ma.\n\nViolence can cause and exacerbate all kinds of\ninsecurities — food, economic and so forth — that are\nthemselves major drivers of mental distress.\n\nMany\nkinds of violence, from interpersonal violence to or ganized crime to armed conflict, perniciously under mine trust in people we know and in people we do not\nknow.\n\nBreakdowns in trust may then beget more in stability, more violence.\n\n“ Mental disorders weigh on human development\nin many ways.\n\nA health issue themselves, they are\noften linked to other health challenges.\n\nThey can\nimpede school attendance and learning, as well\nas the ability to find a job and be fully productive\nat it.\n\nThe stigma that often accompanies\nmental disorders makes matters worse\nThen there is the loss of agency due to violence.\n\nThe\ncomplex interplay of forces, rooted in asymmetries of\npower, is powerfully at work in intimate partner vio lence, whose survivors are predominately women\nand which is correlated with some measures of wom en’s economic dependence (see chapter in the full\nReport).\n\nChannels of dominance at the societal and\ninstitutional levels can take concentrated, wicked\nforms — especially for women, children and older\npeople — behind what are meant to be the safe walls\nof a home, leaving those subjected to domestic abuse\nwith either the perception or the reality of no escape.\n\nThe ensuing entrapment of people violates human\nrights, constrains agency and ultimately undercuts\nour collective ability to navigate a turbulent new era.\n\nAs it has been in so many ways, the Covid-19 pan demic is ominously illustrative.\n\nDuring the first year\nof the pandemic, the global prevalence of depres sion and anxiety increased by more than percent.43\nLow-income people, especially those who struggle\nto afford basic needs such as rent and food, suffered\ndisproportionally in several countries.44 Women, who\nassumed most of the additional domestic and care\nwork that emerged during school closures and lock downs,45 faced much higher mental distress than be fore the crisis.46\nStressors need not reach the level of globalized\ntrauma to cause mental distress.\n\nIn fact, one of the\nmost serious economic threats to mental wellbeing\nseems to stem from repeated financial shocks, such\nas income loss, especially for poor people and for\nmen.47 Economic insecurity — or just the perception\nof such insecurity, even if transitory — is a major fac tor.\n\nMental distress is one reason why economic dis locations, whether from globalization or automation\nor phasing out fossil fuels, carry some large, underap preciated risks.Mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress\ndisorder and depression, can develop when men tal distress is severe and untreated.\n\nAlmost billion\npeople — roughly one in eight of us — live with a men tal disorder,48 providing a lower-bound estimate of\nthe broader problem of mental distress.\n\nGlobally,\nmental health issues are the leading cause of disabil ity.\n\nYet, of those who need mental health attention\nor treatment, only about percent receive it.49 On\naverage, countries spend less than percent of their\nhealthcare budgets on mental health.50\nMental disorders weigh on human development in\nmany ways.\n\nA health issue themselves, they are often\nlinked to other health challenges.",

it is also about purposeful\nsocietal transformations that seek to ease planetary\npressures and leverage the positive potential of new\ntechnologies (see chapter in the full Report).\n\nFrom\nenergy systems to food production to transportation,\neasing planetary pressures demands fundamental\nchanges to much of the way the world currently oper ates.\n\nIt is a necessary, wildly worthwhile investment\n— ethically, environmentally, economically — but it\ncomes with its own significant uncertainties, espe cially for economies, livelihoods and pocketbooks.51\nThe energy transitions required to confront the cli mate crisis would be challenging even in the best of\ntimes.\n\nThey become more so when stacked on top of\ninequalities and social fragmentation, the rapid clip\nof technological disruption and dangerous planetary\nchange.\n\nThe backlash in some countries to various\nforms of energy taxation or carbon pricing is a case\nin point.\n\nHowever welcome new renewable energy\ntechnologies may be at competitive market prices,\nthey carry their own environmental costs and risks,\nincluding those related to mining to supply the mate rials for the world’s solar panels and wind turbines.52\nPeople rightly worry about winners and losers\nwhen big change is on the horizon.\n\nYes, the green\neconomy could add more than million jobs world wide by 2030.53 This is an exciting opportunity for\npeople and planet.\n\nBut these jobs will not necessarily\nbe in the same regions that stand to lose jobs as fos sil fuel industries shut down.\n\nNor will they require the\nsame skills as a fossil fuel–based economy.\n\nNo one\nseems especially interested in a bigger overall pie if\nhis or her piece is feared to be getting much smaller.\n\nNor do people need forecasts or history books to\nknow that societal transformations — however well\nplanned or not, however “good” or not — can radical ly reshape the communities they live in, often in un expected ways where “do-overs” are not possible if\nthings go wrong.\n\nMany around the world have lived\nthrough transformations, some ongoing, in their life times.\n\nThey see them with their own eyes.\n\nThe trans formations in energy and materials required now in\nthe Anthropocene portend even more upheavals,\nwhich some believe to be as large as the shift from ag ricultural to industrial societies.54\nWhether it is the advent of agriculture or the In dustrial Revolution, previous tectonic shifts have\ntypically stretched across multiple generations.\n\nNow,\nthey can happen within a generation, in a matter of\nyears, introducing a new kind of uncertainty or worry.\n\nWhether through foresight or experience, that will\ninfluence how people think about and invest in their\nlives, families and communities and hold their lead ers accountable.\n\nThese are not reasons to give up on\na green economy; we cannot afford to throw in the\ntowel.\n\nBut if we do not understand people’s pres ent and future anxieties and address the underlying\ndrivers, if we do not build trust and the promise of a\nbetter future, progress towards purposeful, just, sus tainable transformations is going to be even harder.\n\nThe net result of today’s uncertainty complex on\ndevelopment is profound.\n\nWe might be facing a grow ing mismatch between what is needed to navigate\nnovel, interacting uncertainties and the current state\nof affairs, categorized by social arrangements (what to do — in terms of policies, institutions) and the behav iours shaped by social context, culture and narratives\n(how to do it — in terms of prevalent identities, values\nand beliefs).\n\nThe interplay of forces — their scales,\nspeeds, unknown interactions and consequences —\nhave made development pathways simultaneously\nfar less obvious and far more open.\n\nWhat should hap pen next can no longer be taken for granted.\n\nA line ar march of progress in which low-income countries\nchase higher income ones is less relevant.\n\nIn a sense\nall countries are developing countries, charting a new\nplanetary course together, regardless of whether they\nwork together to do so.\n\n“ In a sense all countries are developing countries,\ncharting a new planetary course together,\nregardless of whether they work together to do so\nThe question is no longer simply how some coun tries get from point A to point B; instead, it is how\nall countries start moving from wherever they are to\npoints N, T or W — or letters in some new alphabet —\nand then course correct along the way.\n\nDevelopment\nis perhaps better seen as a process characterized both\nby adapting to an unfolding unknown reality and by\npurposefully transforming economies and societies\nto ease planetary pressures and advance inclusion.55\nThere is promise and opportunity in uncertainty\nIf necessity is the mother of invention, then the very\nforces that give rise to today’s uncertainties also offer\nthe means to navigate them.\n\nUncertainty engenders\nthe possibility of change, also for the better.\n\nConsider\nartificial intelligence, a disruptive opportunity at least\nas much as a disruptive threat.",

they constrain the generation of new ideas\nin response to a changing world.\n\nAgency and free doms are antidotes.\n\nPolicies, institutions and cultural\nchange that promote them tend to be fostered by cul tivating four motivating principles: flexibility, solidar ity, creativity and inclusion (see also chapter in the\nfull Report).\n\nThese principles, which can reinforce\none another, will go a long way in making policies and\ninstitutions more fit for purpose.\n\nThe four principles can also have their own inter nal tensions.\n\nBuilding systems with some stabilizing\nredundancies, for example, needs to be balanced\nagainst nimble response capacities.\n\nStill, it is hard\nto be quick on one’s feet if one is constantly getting\nknocked over by a financial meltdown, novel virus or\nmonster hurricane.\n\nSimilarly, there is a give and take\nto creative exploration and concerted, purposeful\naction anchored in human rights.\n\nStriking the right\nbalance among the four motivating principles will be\nkey, and trust is essential to doing so.\n\nPeople will be\nsuspicious of the negotiation table if they fear that the\nchair will be constantly jerked out from under them.\n\nPolicy development will be an iterative, trial-and-er ror process in which we must all learn from each\nother.\n\nPolicies and institutions to invest, insure and innovate\nThere are no policy panaceas, no one-size-fits-all\napproaches.\n\nEven so, some policies form the build ing blocks for countries and communities as they\nnavigate today’s uncertainty complex towards more\nhopeful futures.\n\nThey fall into three overlapping, mu tually reinforcing categories: investment, insurance\nand innovation — the Three I’s (figure 10;

change.\n\nMedia in its many forms plays a big\nrole here.\n\nIn Bangladesh a popular animated televi sion show reduced the cultural and religious stigma\nof girls going to school in rural areas and increased\ntheir attendance.70 In Ghana and Kenya the Time to Change campaign made inroads into reducing men tal health stigma.71\nThe issue is not just about recipients of pro grammes or target audiences but also about who is\ndeciding on and delivering the messages.\n\nFor exam ple, women’s representation in political bodies shifts\npolicy priorities and expands aspirations for other\nwomen and girls.\n\nSocial movements have important\nroles as well in advancing human rights and changing\ncultural norms and narratives to expand agency and\nfreedoms (see chapter in the full Report).\n\n“ Walls between our social connections\nare perhaps more insidiously damaging and\npolarizing than walls between nations\nEssential to flexible and adaptable narratives, in\nbuilding trust and social cohesion for more hopeful\nfutures, is the freedom for each person to have and\nmove among different identities in different social\ncontexts (see chapter in the full Report).72 Walls be tween our social connections are perhaps more insid iously damaging and polarizing than walls between\nnations.\n\nThe bridges that connect different groups are\namong our most important assets.\n\nGood leaders re habilitate and strengthen them and help us use them\n— especially in the face of unknowns.\n\nDemagogues\ntry to burn them down, replacing fluid connection,\nexchange and learning with zero-sum, us-versusthem narratives.\n\nInstead of trying out cultural scripts\nprecisely when experimentation matters most, peo ple become trapped by them.\n\nWhere we go from here is up to us\nWe must learn to live with today’s uncertainty com plex, just as we must learn to live with Covid-19.\n\nThis\nyear’s Human Development Report challenges us to\naspire to more than mere accommodation, however.\n\nBy unlocking our human potential, by tapping into\nour creativity and diversity anchored in trust and sol idarity, it challenges us to imagine and create futures\nin which we thrive.\n\nThe encouraging words of the\nlate, great poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou\nring as true as ever, reminding us “to bring all our en ergies to each encounter, to remain flexible enough to\nnotice and admit when what we expected to happen\ndid not happen.\n\nWe need to remember that we are\ncreated creative and can invent new scenarios as fre quently as they are needed.”73\nWhere we go from here is up to us.\n\nOne of the great\nlessons of our species’ history is that we can accom plish a lot with very little if we work together towards\nshared goals.\n\nIf there is a secret ingredient to human\nmagic, that must be it.\n\nThe challenges in the Anthro pocene and in sweeping societal transformations are\nhuge, even daunting, all the more so for countries and\ncommunities struggling with the most dramatic and\nunjust deprivations.\n\nInsecurity and polarization make things worse.\n\nAmid so much uncertainty, the truth is\nthat we are not going to get it right, maybe not even\nmost of the time.\n\nIn this turbulent new era we can\nset the direction but cannot guarantee the outcome.\n\nThe good news is that we have more tools than ever to\nhelp us navigate and course correct.\n\nBut no amount of\ntechnological wizardry is a substitute for good lead ership, collective action or trust.\n\nIf we can start fixing\nthe human side of the planetary ledger — and this Re port tries to highlight how — then the future, however\nuncertain, will be more promise than peril, just as it\nshould be.",
