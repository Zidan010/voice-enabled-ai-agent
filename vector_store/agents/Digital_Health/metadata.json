It promotes the protection of people, populations,\nhealth care professionals and systems against misinformation and\nthe misuse of information, malicious cyber activities, fraud and\nexploitation, inappropriate use of health data, racism and human\nrights violations within the framework established by international\ntreaties binding the Member States.\nThe “digital determinants of health” , such as literacy in information\nand communication technologies and access to equipment,\nbroadband and the internet, become more important as digital\nhealth becomes more prevalent. The global strategy underscores the\nneed to ground digital foundations within national strategies and\nemphasizes the need to work with different sectors and stakeholders\nat all levels.\nThe global strategy promotes syntactic and semantic interoperability\nwith WHO norms and standards as a cornerstone of health\ninformation to enable sharing of information in a connected world.\nThe appropriate use of digital health takes the following dimensions\ninto consideration: health promotion and disease prevention, patient\nsafety, ethics, interoperability, intellectual property, data security\n(confidentiality, integrity, and availability), privacy, cost-effectiveness,\npatient engagement, and affordability. It should be people-centred,\ntrust-based, evidence-based, effective, efficient, sustainable,\ninclusive, equitable and contextualized. The growing global challenge\nof digital waste on health and the environment must also be\nappropriately managed.3\n17Recognize the urgent need to address the major impediments\nfaced by least-developed countries implementing digital\nhealth technologies\nThere is a pressing need to invest in efforts to overcome the major\nimpediments that developing countries face in engaging with and\naccessing new digital health technologies, such as an appropriate\nenabling environment, sufficient resources, infrastructure to support\nthe digital transformation, education, human capacity, financial\ninvestment and internet connectivity, as well as issues related to\nlegacy infrastructure, technology ownership, privacy, security, and\nadapting and implementing global standards and technology flows.4\nknowledge on digital health\nThis strategic objective aims to align countries and stakeholders to\ncollectively act upon global opportunities to improve health and\nwork towards universal health coverage, while meeting challenges,\nidentifying and communicating risks, and focusing on threats\nassociated with the use of digital technologies both to improve health\nand to enable universal health coverage, the core of the healthrelated Sustainable Development Goals. This objective encourages\naction on common opportunities and challenges that are relevant to\nall countries and stakeholders, regardless of their situation.\nMaximize the impact of both new and existing collaborations and\npartnerships in the wider digital health ecosystem. Knowledge of and\ninvestments in digital health design and implementation are shared\nacross domains; hence this strategic objective aims to maximize\ncollaborations and partnerships with other agencies within the\nUnited Nations system, countries and other stakeholders and to help\nto build new ones.\nAssess and promote the latest, appropriate and innovative health\ntechnologies. Pioneering health technologies are creating new and\nadvanced health care services and solutions. This sub-objective\nhelps to ensure that the quality and outcome of the new health\ntechnologies are assessed in order to enable their timely adoption\nand promotion. Norms, standards, policies and regulations are\nneeded to ensure the investment, sustainability, quality, security\nand safety of both digital health products and cutting-edge health\ntechnologies that not only are used in health care but that may also\nbe directly marketed to individuals.

These should all be developed while the necessary\nalignment of country stakeholders is ensured in order that the needs\nand expectations with given resources be met.\nThe strategic objective aims to develop cross-sectoral partnerships\nat national level to align resources and investments to ensure the\nsustainability and growth of digital health. The objective also seeks to\nwork with existing digital health partnerships to advance global digital\nhealth efforts. Developing national partnerships for the sustainability\nof digital health advances would accelerate their adoption by\nMember States.\nAlthough each country is expected to review or develop and own its\nstrategy from inception to implementation, this strategic objective\naims to build human and institutional capacity for the safe and\nappropriate use and scale-up of digital health by strengthening the\ncommitment and systematic engagement of all stakeholders in\nevery country.

The individual is an\nessential component in the delivery of trust-based, people-centred\ncare. This focus covers not only patients, families and communities\nbut also the health workers who need to be prepared to deploy or\nuse digital health technologies in their work. Planning for capacitybuilding includes workforce assessment, ranging from professionals\nin information and communication technologies to health workers\nproviding care services. Being intrinsically multidisciplinary and\ninterdisciplinary, capacity-building entails instilling capabilities,\nattitudes and skills which may range from computer sciences,\nstrategic planning, finance and management to health sciences\nand care delivery, depending on the digital health application and\nits context. Assessment of the workforce should also consider the\nimplications for the health labour market of introducing digital\ntechnologies and their management. This objective would call for\ncountries to move away from the current disease focused systems to\nan integrated approach with the patient at the centre.\nAttitudes to, practices in and public awareness of digital health\nshould also be addressed. Possible actions include improving digital\nhealth literacy at the population level, engagement of patients,\nfamilies and communities, and education of patients about health.\nBetter responding to the social and commercial determinants of\nhealth to improve digital health-enabled health systems will need the\nengagement of civil society but also non-health sectors and actors.\nIncreasing awareness of evidence based self-management tools and\nincreasing access to these is a further action to consider.Human-centre d health systems",
