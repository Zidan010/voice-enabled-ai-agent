objectives.\n\nA Target Profile\nconsiders anticipated changes to the organization’s cybersecurity posture, such as new\nrequirements, new technology adoption, and threat intelligence trends.\n\nA Community P rofile is a baseline of CSF outcomes that is created and published to address\nshared intere sts and goals among a number of organizations .\n\nA Community Profile is\ntypically developed for a particular sector , subsector, technology , threat type, or other use\ncase .\n\nAn organization can use a Community Profile as the basis for its own Target Profile .\n\nExamples of Community Profiles can be found on the NIST CSF website .\n\nThe\nsteps shown in Fig.\n\n3 and summarized below illustrate one way that an organization could\nuse an Organizational Profile to help inform continuous improvement of its cybersecurity.\n\nNIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024\n7 1.\n\nScope the Organizational Profile.\n\nDocument the high- level facts and assumptions on\nwhich the Profile will be based to define its scope .\n\nAn organization can have as many\nOrganizational Profiles as desired , each with a different scope .\n\nFor example, a Profile\ncould address an entire organization or be scoped to an organization’s financial systems\nor to countering ransomware threats and handling ransomware incidents involving\nthose financial systems.\n\n2.\n\nGather the information needed to prepare the Organizational Profile.\n\nExamples of\ninformation may include organizational policies, risk management priorities and\nresources, enterprise risk profiles, business impact analysis registers, cybersecurity\nrequirements and standards followed by the organization, practices and tools (e.g.,\nprocedures and safeguards), and work roles.\n\n3.\n\nCreate the Organizational Profile.\n\nDetermine what types of information the Profile\nshould include for the selected CSF outcomes, and document the needed information.\n\nConsider the risk implications of the Current Profile to inform Target Profile planning and prioritization.\n\nAlso, consider using a Community Profile as the basis for the Target\nProfile.\n\n4.\n\nAnalyze the gaps between the Current and Target Profiles , and create an action plan.\n\nConduct a gap analysis to i dentify and analyz e the differences between the Current and\nTarget Profiles , and develop a prioritized action plan (e.g., r isk register, risk detail report,\nPlan of Action and Milestones [POA&M]) to address those gaps.\n\n5.\n\nImplement the action plan, and update the Organizational Profile.\n\nFollow the action\nplan to address the gaps and move the organization toward the Target Profile .\n\nAn action\nplan may have an overall deadline or be ongoing.\n\nGiven the importance of continual improvement, an organization can repeat these steps as often as needed.\n\nThere are additional uses for Organizational Profiles.\n\nFor example, a Current Profile can be used\nto document and communicate the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and known opportunities for improvement with external stakeholders , such as business partners or\nprospective customers.\n\nAlso, a Target Profile can help express the organization’s cybersecurity\nrisk management requirements and expectations to suppliers, partners, and other third parties\nas a target for those parties to achieve .\n\n3.2.\n\nCSF Tiers\nAn o rganization can choose to use the Tiers to inform its Current and Target Profil es.\n\nTiers\ncharacterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management\npractices , and they provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the\nprocesses in place to manage those risks.\n\nThe Tiers , as shown in Fig.\n\n4 and notionally illustrated\nin Appendix B , reflect an organization’s practices for managing cybersecurity risk as Partial (Tier\n1), Risk Informed (Tier 2), Repeatable (Tier 3), and Adaptive (Tier 4).\n\nThe Tiers describe a\nprogression from informal, ad hoc responses to approaches that are agile , risk-informed , and\nNIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024\n8 continuously improving .\n\nSelecting Tiers helps set the overall tone for how an organization will\nmanage its cybersecurity risks .\n\nTiers should complement an organization’s cybersecurity risk management methodology rather\nthan replace it .\n\nFor example, an organization can use the Tiers to communicate internally as a\nbenchmark for a n organization -wide1\n1 For the purposes of this document, the terms “organization -wide” and “enterprise” have the same meaning .\n\napproach to managing cybersecurity risks .\n\nProgression to\nhigher Tiers is encouraged when risks or mandates are greater or when a cost -benefit analysis\nindicates a feasible and cost -effective reduction of negative cybersecurity risk s.\n\nThe NIST CSF website provides additional information on using Profiles a nd Tiers .\n\nIt includes\npointers to NIST -hosted O rganizational Profile templates and a repository of Community\nProfiles in a variety of machine -read able and human -usable formats.\n\nNIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024\n9 4.\n\nIntroduction to Online Resources That Supplement the CSF\nNIST and other organizations have produced a suite of online resources that help organizations\nunderstand, adopt, and use the CSF .\n\nSince they are hosted online, these additional resources\ncan be updated more frequently than this document, which is updated infrequently to provide\nstability to its users, and be available in machine -readable formats.\n\nThis section provides an\noverview of three types of online resources : Informative References, Implementation Examples,\nand Quick Start Guides .\n\nInformative References are mappings that indicat e relationships between the Core and various\nstandards, guidelines, regulations, and other content.\n\nInformative References help inform how\nan organization may achieve the Core’s outcomes .\n\nInformative References can be sector - or\ntechnology -specific.\n\nThey may be produced by NIST or another organization.",

will vary based on an organization’s unique mission and risks .\n\nWith an\nunderstanding of stakeholder expectations and risk appetite and tolerance (as outlined in\nGOVERN ), an organization can prioritize cybersecurity activities to make informed decisions\nabout cybersecurity expenditures and actions .\n\nAn o rganization may choose to handle risk in one\nor more ways — including mitigating , transferring, avoiding, or accepting negative risks and\nrealizing, sharing, enhancing, or accepting positive risks — depending on the potential impact s\nand likelihoods .\n\nImportantly, an organization can use the CSF both internally to manage its\ncybersecurity capabilities and externally to oversee or communicate with third parties.\n\nRegardles s of the CSF’s utilization , an organization may benefit from using the CSF as guidance\nto help it understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks and the actions\nthat will manage those risks.\n\nThe selected outcomes can be used to focus on and implement\nstrategic decisions to improve cybersecurity posture s and maintain continuity of mission essential functions while taking priorities and available resources into account.\n\n5.1.\n\nImprov ing Risk Management Communication\nThe CSF provides a basis for improved communication regarding cybersecurity expectations,\nplanning, and resources.\n\nThe CSF fosters bidirectional information flow (as shown in the top\nhalf of Fig.\n\n5) between executives who focus on the organization’s priorities and strategic\ndirection and managers who manage specific cybersecurity risks that could affect the\nachievement of those priorities .\n\nThe CSF also supports a similar flow (as shown in the bottom\nhalf of Fig.\n\n5) between managers and the practitioners who implement and operate the\ntechnologies .\n\nThe lef t side of the figure indicates the importance of practitioners sharing their\nupdates, insights, and concerns with managers and executives.\n\nNIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024\n11 Preparing to creat e and us e Organizational Profiles involve s gathering information about\norganizational priorities, resources, and risk direction from executives .\n\nManagers then\ncollaborate with practitioners to communicate business needs and create risk -informed\nOrganizational Profiles.\n\nActions to close any gaps identified between the Current and Target\nProfiles will be implemented by managers and practitioners and will provide key inputs into\nsystem -level plans.\n\nAs the target state is achieved throughout the organization — including\nthrough controls and monitoring applied at the system level — the updated results can be\nshared through risk registers and progress reports.\n\nAs part of ongoing assessment, managers\ngain insights to make adjustments that further reduce potential harm s and increase potential\nbenefits.\n\nThe GOVERN Function supports organizational risk communication with executives .\n\nExecutives’\ndiscussion s involve strategy, particularly how cybersecurity- related uncertainties might affect\nthe achievement of organizationa l objectives.\n\nThese governance discussions support dialogue\nand agreement about risk management strateg ies (including cybersecurity supply chain risk);\nroles , responsibilities, and authorities; policies; and oversight.\n\nAs executives establish\ncybersecurity priorities and objectives based on those needs, they communicate expectations\nabout risk appetite, accountability , and resources .\n\nExecutives are also responsible for\nintegrating cybersecurity risk management with ERM programs and lower -level risk\nmanagement programs (see Sec.\n\n5.2 ).\n\nThe communications reflected in the top half of Fig.\n\n5 can\ninclude considerations for ERM and the lower -level programs and, thus , inform managers and\npractitioners .\n\nThe overall cybersecurity objectives set by executives are informed by and cascade to\nmanagers .\n\nIn a commer cial entity, these may apply to a line-of-business or operating division.\n\nFor government entities , these may be division - or branch- level considerations .",

and prioritizing\ncontrols from SP 800 -5 3, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and\nOrganizations .\n\n- Privacy risk s: While cybersecurity and privacy are independent disciplines, their\nobjectives overlap in certain circumstances, as illustrated in NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024\nCybersecurity risk management is essential for addressing privacy risks related to the\nloss of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individuals’ data.\n\nFor example,\ndata breaches could lead to identity theft.\n\nHowever, privacy risks can also arise by means that are unrelated to cybersecurity incidents .\n\nAn o rganization process es data to achieve mission or business purposes, which can\nsometimes give rise to privacy events whereby individuals may experience problems as\na result of the data proces sing.\n\nThe se problems can be expressed in various ways, but\nNIST describes them as ranging from dignity -type effects (e.g., embarrassment or\nstigma ) to more tangible harms (e.g., discrimination, economic loss, or physical harm) .\n\nThe NIST Privacy Framework a nd Cybersecurity Framework can be used together to\naddress the different aspects of cybersecurity and privacy risks.\n\nAdditionally, NIST’s\nPrivacy Risk Assessment Methodology h as a catalog of example problems for\nuse in privacy risk assessment s.\n\n- Suppl y chain risk s: An o rganization can use t he CSF to foster cybersecurity risk oversight\nand communications with stakeholders across supply chains.\n\nAll types of technology rely\non a complex, globally distributed, extensive, and interconnected supply chain\necosystem with geographically diverse routes and multiple levels of outsourcing.\n\nThis\necosystem is composed of public - and private -sector entities (e.g., acquirers, suppliers,\ndevelopers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other technology -related service providers) that interact to research, develop, design,\nmanufacture, acquire, deliver, integrate, operate, maintain, dispose of, and otherwise utilize or manage technology products and services.\n\nThese interactions are shaped and influenced by technologies, laws, policies, procedures, and practices.\n\nGiven the complex and interconnected relationships in this ecosystem , supply chain risk\nmanagement is critical for organizations.",
