1 1. Cybersecurity Framework Overview
This document is version 2.0 of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework ( Framework or CSF). It
includes the following components :
- CSF Core , the nucleus of the CSF, which is a taxonomy of high- level cybersecurity
outcomes that can help any organization manage its cybersecurity risk s. The CSF Core
components are a hierarchy of Functions , Categor ies, and Subcategor ies that detail each
outcome. These outcomes can be understood by a broad audience, including
executives, managers, and practitioners, regardless of their cybersecurity expertise.
Because the outcomes are sector -, country -, and technology -neut ral, they provide an
organization with the flexibility needed to address its unique risk s, technolog ies, and
mission considerations.
- CSF Organizational Profiles , which are a mechanism for describing an organization’s
current and/ or target cybersecurity posture in terms of the CSF Core’s outcomes.
- CSF Tiers , which can be applied to CSF Organizational Profiles to characterize the rigor of
an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management practices . Tiers can
also provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the processes
in place to manage those risks.
This document describes what desirable outcomes an organization can aspire to achieve. It
does not prescribe outcomes nor how they may be achieved. Descriptions of how an
organization can achieve those outcomes are provided in a suite of online resources that
complement the CSF and are available through the NIST CSF website . These resources offer
additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve outcome s and are
intended to help an organization understand, adopt, and use the CSF. They include:
- Informative References that point to sources of guidance on each outcome from existing
global standards, guidelines, frameworks, regulations, policies, etc.
- Implementation Examples that illustrate potential ways to achieve each outcome
- Quick -Start Guides that give actionable guidance on using the CSF and its online
resources , including transitioning from previous CSF versions to version 2.0
- Community Profiles and Organizational Profile Templates that help an organization put
the CSF into practice and set priorities for managing cybersecurity risks
An organization can use the CSF Core, Profiles, and Tiers with the supplementary resources to
understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks .
- Understand and Assess: Describe the current or target cybersecurity posture of part or
all of an organization, determine gaps, and assess progress toward addressing those gaps.
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
2 - Prioritize: Identify, organize, and prioritize actions for managing cybersecurity risks that
align with the organization’s mission, legal and regulatory requirements, and risk
management and governance expectations.
- Communicate: Provide a common language for communicating inside and outside the
organization about cybersecurity risks, capabilities, needs, and expectations.
The CSF is de signed to be used by organizations of all sizes and sectors, including industry,
government, academia, and nonprofit organizations, regardless of the maturity level of their cybersecurity programs. The CSF is a foundational resource that may be adopted voluntarily
and through governmental policies and mandates . The CSF’s taxonomy and referenced
standards, guidelines, and practices are not country -specific , and previous versions of the CSF
have been leveraged successfully by many governments and other organi zations both inside
and outside of the United States.
The CSF should be used in conjunction with other resources (e.g., frameworks, standards,
guidelines, leading practices ) to better manage cybersecurity risks and inform the overall
management of informat ion and communications technology risks at an enterprise level.
The CSF is a flexible framework that is intended to be tailored for use by all organizations
regardless of size . Organizations will continue to have unique risks — including different threats
and vulnerabilities — and risk tolerances, as well as unique mission objectives and
requirements. Thus, organizations’ approaches to managing risk s and their implementations of
the CSF will vary.
The remainder of this document is structur ed as follows :
- Section 2 explains the basics of the CSF Core: Functions, Categories, and Subcategories .
- Section 3 defines the concepts of CSF Profiles and Tiers.
- Section 4 provides an overview of selected components of the CSF’s suite of online
resources : Informative References, Implementation Examples, and Quick Start Guides .
- Section 5 discusses how an organization can integrat e the CSF with other risk
management programs .
- Appendix A is the CSF Core.
- Appendix B contains a notional illustration of the CSF Tiers.
- Appendix C is a glossary of CSF terminology.
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
3 2. Introduction to the CSF Core
Appendix A is the CSF Core — a set of cybersecurity outcomes arranged by Function, then
Category, and finally Subcategory , as depicted in actions to perform ; specific actions taken to achieve an outcome will vary by organization and
use case , as will the individual responsible for those actions. Additionally, the order and size of
Functions, Categories, and Subcategories in the Core does not imply the sequence or
importance of achieving them . The structure of the Core is intended to resonate most with
those charged with operationaliz ing risk management within an organization.
The CSF Core Functions — G OVERN , IDENTIFY , PROTECT , DETECT , RESPOND , and RECOVER — organize
cybersecurity outcomes at their highest level.
- GOVERN — The organization’s cybersecurity risk management strategy,
expectations, and policy are established, communicated, and monitored. The GOVERN
Function provides outcomes to inform what an organization may do to achieve and
prioritize the outcomes of the other five Functions in the context of its mission and
stakeholder expectations . Governance activities are critical for incorporating
cybersecurity into an organization’s broader enterprise risk management
strategy. GOVERN addres ses an understanding of organizational context ; the
establishment of cybersecurity strategy and cybersecurity supply chain risk
management; roles, responsibilities, and authorities; polic y; and the oversight of
cybersecurity strategy .
- IDENTIFY — The organization’s current cybersecurity risk s are understood.
Understanding the organization’s assets ( e.g., data, hardware , software, systems,
facilities, services, people) , suppliers, and related cybersecurity risks enables an
organization to prioritize its efforts consistent with its risk management strategy and the
mission needs identified under GOVERN . This Function also includes the identification of
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
4 improvement opportunities for the organization’s policies, plans, processes, procedures ,
and practices that support cybersecurity risk management to inform efforts under all six
Functions .
- PROTECT — Safeguards to manage the organization’s cybersecurity risk s are used.
Once assets and risks are identified and prioritized , PROTECT supports the ability to
secure those assets to prevent or lower the likelihood and impact of adverse
cybersecurity events , as well as to increase the likelihood and impact of taking
advantage of opportunities . Outcomes covered by this Function include identity
management, authentication, and access control; awareness and training; data security;
platform security (i.e., securing the hardware, software, and services of physical and
virtual platforms ); and the resilience of technology infrastructure.
- DETECT — Possible cybersecurity attacks and compromises are found and analyzed.
DETECT enables the timely discovery and analysis of anomalies, indicators of
compromise, and other potentially adverse events that may indicate that cybersecurity
attacks and incidents are occurring . This Function supports success ful incident response
and recovery activities .
- RESPOND — Action s regarding a detected cybersecurity inciden t are taken. RESPOND
supports the ability to contain the effects of cybersecurity incidents. Outcomes within
this Function cover incident management, analysis, mitigation, reporting , and
communication.
- RECOVER — Assets and operations affected by a cybersecurity incident are restored .
RECOVER supports the timely restoration of normal operations to reduce the effects of
cybersecurity incidents and enable appropriate communication during recovery efforts .
For example, an organization will categorize assets under I DENTIFY and take steps to secure
those assets under P ROTECT . Investments in planning and testing in the G OVERN and IDENTIFY
Functions will support timely detection of unexpected events in the D ETECT Function, as well as
enabling incident response and recovery action s for cybersecurity incidents in the RESPOND and
RECOVER Functions. GOVERN is in the center of the wheel because it informs how an organization
will implement the other five Functions.
While many cybersecurity risk management activities focus on pre venting negative events
from occurring , they may also support taking advantage of positive opportunities . Actions to
reduce cybersecurity risk might benefit an organization in other ways, like increasing
revenue (e.g., first offering excess facility space to a commercial hosting provider for hosting
their own and other organizations’ data centers, then moving a major financial system from
the organization’s in -house data center to the hosting provider to reduce cybersecurity
risks).
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
The Functions should be addressed concurrently. Actions that support GOVERN , IDENTIFY , PROTECT ,
and DETECT should all happen continuously, and actions that support RESPOND and RECOVER
should be ready at all times and happen when cybersecurity incidents occur. All Functions have
vital roles related to cybersecurity incidents . GOVERN , IDENTIFY , and PROTECT outcomes help
prevent and prepare for incidents, while G OVERN , DETECT , RESPOND , and RECOVER outcomes help
discover and manage incidents.
Each Function is named after a verb that summarizes its contents . Each Function is divided into
Categories , which are related cybersecurity outcomes that collectively comprise the Function .
Subcategories further divide each Category into more specific outcomes of technical and
management activities. The Subcategories are not exhaustive, but they describe detailed
outcomes that support each Category.
The Functions, Categories, and Subcategories appl y to al l ICT used by an organization, including
information technology, the Internet of Things (IoT), and operational technology. They
also apply to all types of technology environments, including cloud, mobile, and artificial
intelligence systems. The CSF Core is forward -looking and intended to apply to future changes
in technologies and environments.

6 3. Introduction to CSF Profiles and Tiers
This section defines the concepts of CSF Profiles and Tiers.
3.1. CSF Profiles
A CSF Organizational Profile describ es an organization’s current and/ or target cybersecurity
posture in terms of the Core’s outcomes . Organizational Profiles are used to understand, tailor,
assess, prioritize, and communicate the Core ’s outcomes by considering an organization’s
mission objectives, stakeholder expectations, threat landscape, and requirements . An
organization can then prioritize its actions to achieve specific outcomes and communicate that
information to stakeholders.
Every Organizational Profile includes one or both of the following :
1. A Cur rent Profile specifies the Core outcomes that an organization is currently achieving
(or attempting to achieve) and characterizes how or to what extent each outcome is
being achieved.
2. A Target Profile specifies the desired outcomes that an organization has selected and
prioritized for achieving its cybersecurity risk manageme nt objectives. A Target Profile
considers anticipated changes to the organization’s cybersecurity posture, such as new
requirements, new technology adoption, and threat intelligence trends.
A Community P rofile is a baseline of CSF outcomes that is created and published to address
shared intere sts and goals among a number of organizations . A Community Profile is
typically developed for a particular sector , subsector, technology , threat type, or other use
case . An organization can use a Community Profile as the basis for its own Target Profile .
Examples of Community Profiles can be found on the NIST CSF website .
The
steps shown in Fig. 3 and summarized below illustrate one way that an organization could
use an Organizational Profile to help inform continuous improvement of its cybersecurity.
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
7 1. Scope the Organizational Profile. Document the high- level facts and assumptions on
which the Profile will be based to define its scope . An organization can have as many
Organizational Profiles as desired , each with a different scope . For example, a Profile
could address an entire organization or be scoped to an organization’s financial systems
or to countering ransomware threats and handling ransomware incidents involving
those financial systems.
2. Gather the information needed to prepare the Organizational Profile. Examples of
information may include organizational policies, risk management priorities and
resources, enterprise risk profiles, business impact analysis registers, cybersecurity
requirements and standards followed by the organization, practices and tools (e.g.,
procedures and safeguards), and work roles.
3. Create the Organizational Profile. Determine what types of information the Profile
should include for the selected CSF outcomes, and document the needed information.
Consider the risk implications of the Current Profile to inform Target Profile planning and prioritization. Also, consider using a Community Profile as the basis for the Target
Profile.
4. Analyze the gaps between the Current and Target Profiles , and create an action plan.
Conduct a gap analysis to i dentify and analyz e the differences between the Current and
Target Profiles , and develop a prioritized action plan (e.g., r isk register, risk detail report,
Plan of Action and Milestones [POA&M]) to address those gaps.
5. Implement the action plan, and update the Organizational Profile. Follow the action
plan to address the gaps and move the organization toward the Target Profile . An action
plan may have an overall deadline or be ongoing.
Given the importance of continual improvement, an organization can repeat these steps as often as needed.
There are additional uses for Organizational Profiles. For example, a Current Profile can be used
to document and communicate the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and known opportunities for improvement with external stakeholders , such as business partners or
prospective customers. Also, a Target Profile can help express the organization’s cybersecurity
risk management requirements and expectations to suppliers, partners, and other third parties
as a target for those parties to achieve .
3.2. CSF Tiers
An o rganization can choose to use the Tiers to inform its Current and Target Profil es. Tiers
characterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management
practices , and they provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the
processes in place to manage those risks. The Tiers , as shown in Fig. 4 and notionally illustrated
in Appendix B , reflect an organization’s practices for managing cybersecurity risk as Partial (Tier
1), Risk Informed (Tier 2), Repeatable (Tier 3), and Adaptive (Tier 4). The Tiers describe a
progression from informal, ad hoc responses to approaches that are agile , risk-informed , and
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
8 continuously improving . Selecting Tiers helps set the overall tone for how an organization will
manage its cybersecurity risks .
Tiers should complement an organization’s cybersecurity risk management methodology rather
than replace it . For example, an organization can use the Tiers to communicate internally as a
benchmark for a n organization -wide1
1 For the purposes of this document, the terms “organization -wide” and “enterprise” have the same meaning . approach to managing cybersecurity risks . Progression to
higher Tiers is encouraged when risks or mandates are greater or when a cost -benefit analysis
indicates a feasible and cost -effective reduction of negative cybersecurity risk s.
The NIST CSF website provides additional information on using Profiles a nd Tiers . It includes
pointers to NIST -hosted O rganizational Profile templates and a repository of Community
Profiles in a variety of machine -read able and human -usable formats.
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
9 4. Introduction to Online Resources That Supplement the CSF
NIST and other organizations have produced a suite of online resources that help organizations
understand, adopt, and use the CSF . Since they are hosted online, these additional resources
can be updated more frequently than this document, which is updated infrequently to provide
stability to its users, and be available in machine -readable formats. This section provides an
overview of three types of online resources : Informative References, Implementation Examples,
and Quick Start Guides .
Informative References are mappings that indicat e relationships between the Core and various
standards, guidelines, regulations, and other content. Informative References help inform how
an organization may achieve the Core’s outcomes . Informative References can be sector - or
technology -specific. They may be produced by NIST or another organization. S ome Informative
References are narrower in scope than a Subcategory. For example, a particular control from SP
800- 53, S ecurity and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations , may be one of
many references needed to achieve the outcome described in one Subcategory. Other
Informative References may be higher -level , such as a requirement from a polic y that partially
address es numerous Subcategor ies. When using the CSF, an organization can identify the most
relevant Informative References.
Implementation Examples provide notional examples of concise, action- oriented steps to help
achieve the outcomes of the Subcategories. Verbs used to express Examples include s hare,
document, develop, perform , monitor, analyze, assess, and exercise . The Examples are not a
comprehensive list of all actions that could be taken by an organization to achieve an outcome,
nor do they re present a baseline of required actions to address cybersecurity risk s.
Quick -Start Guides (QSGs) are brief documents on specific CSF -related topics and are often
tailored to specific audiences . QSGs can help an organization implement the CSF because they
distill specific portions of the CSF into actionable “ first steps ” that an organization can consider
on the path to impr oving their cybersecurity posture and management of associated risks. The
guides are revised i n their own time frames, and new guides are added as need ed.
Suggestions for new Informative References for CSF 2.0 can always be shared with NIST at
olir@nist.gov . Suggestions for other resources to reference on the NIST CSF website, including
additional QSG topics, should be directed to cyberframew ork@nist.gov .
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
10 5. Improving Cybersecurity Risk Communication and Integration
The CSF’s use will vary based on an organization’s unique mission and risks . With an
understanding of stakeholder expectations and risk appetite and tolerance (as outlined in
GOVERN ), an organization can prioritize cybersecurity activities to make informed decisions
about cybersecurity expenditures and actions . An o rganization may choose to handle risk in one
or more ways — including mitigating , transferring, avoiding, or accepting negative risks and
realizing, sharing, enhancing, or accepting positive risks — depending on the potential impact s
and likelihoods . Importantly, an organization can use the CSF both internally to manage its
cybersecurity capabilities and externally to oversee or communicate with third parties.
Regardles s of the CSF’s utilization , an organization may benefit from using the CSF as guidance
to help it understand, assess, prioritize, and communicate cybersecurity risks and the actions
that will manage those risks. The selected outcomes can be used to focus on and implement
strategic decisions to improve cybersecurity posture s and maintain continuity of mission essential functions while taking priorities and available resources into account.
5.1. Improv ing Risk Management Communication
The CSF provides a basis for improved communication regarding cybersecurity expectations,
planning, and resources. The CSF fosters bidirectional information flow (as shown in the top
half of Fig. 5) between executives who focus on the organization’s priorities and strategic
direction and managers who manage specific cybersecurity risks that could affect the
achievement of those priorities . The CSF also supports a similar flow (as shown in the bottom
half of Fig. 5) between managers and the practitioners who implement and operate the
technologies . The lef t side of the figure indicates the importance of practitioners sharing their
updates, insights, and concerns with managers and executives.
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
11 Preparing to creat e and us e Organizational Profiles involve s gathering information about
organizational priorities, resources, and risk direction from executives . Managers then
collaborate with practitioners to communicate business needs and create risk -informed
Organizational Profiles. Actions to close any gaps identified between the Current and Target
Profiles will be implemented by managers and practitioners and will provide key inputs into
system -level plans. As the target state is achieved throughout the organization — including
through controls and monitoring applied at the system level — the updated results can be
shared through risk registers and progress reports. As part of ongoing assessment, managers
gain insights to make adjustments that further reduce potential harm s and increase potential
benefits.
The GOVERN Function supports organizational risk communication with executives . Executives’
discussion s involve strategy, particularly how cybersecurity- related uncertainties might affect
the achievement of organizationa l objectives. These governance discussions support dialogue
and agreement about risk management strateg ies (including cybersecurity supply chain risk);
roles , responsibilities, and authorities; policies; and oversight. As executives establish
cybersecurity priorities and objectives based on those needs, they communicate expectations
about risk appetite, accountability , and resources . Executives are also responsible for
integrating cybersecurity risk management with ERM programs and lower -level risk
management programs (see Sec. 5.2 ). The communications reflected in the top half of Fig. 5 can
include considerations for ERM and the lower -level programs and, thus , inform managers and
practitioners .
The overall cybersecurity objectives set by executives are informed by and cascade to
managers . In a commer cial entity, these may apply to a line-of-business or operating division.
For government entities , these may be division - or branch- level considerations . When
implementing the CSF, managers will focus on how to achieve risk targets through common
services, controls, and collaboration, as expressed in the Target Profile and improved through
the actions being tracked in the action plan (e.g., risk register, risk detail report, POA&M) .
Practitioners focus on implementing the target state and measuring changes in operational risk
to help plan, carry out, and monitor specific cybersecurity activities. As controls are
implemented to manage risk at an acceptable level, practitioners provi de managers and
executives with the information (e.g., key performance indicators, key risk indicators) they need
to understand the organization’s cybersecurity posture, make informed decisions , and maintain
or adjust the risk strategy accordingly. Executives can also combine this cybersecurity risk data
with information about other types of risk from across the organization. Updates to
expectations and priorities are included in updated Organizational Profiles as the cycle repeats.
5.2. Impr oving Integration with Other Risk Management Programs
Every organization faces numerous types of ICT risk (e.g., privacy, supply chain, artificial
intelligence ) and may use frameworks and management tools that are specific to each risk .
Some organizations integrate ICT and all other risk management efforts at a high level by using
ERM , while others keep the efforts separate to ensure adequate attention on each. Small
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
12 organizations by their nature may monitor risk at the enterprise level, while larger companies
may maintain separate risk management efforts integrated into the ERM.
Organizations can employ an ERM approach to balance a portfolio of risk considerations,
including cybersecurity , and make informed decisions . Executives receive s ignificant input
about current and planned risk activities as they integrate governance and risk strateg ies with
results from previous uses of the CSF . The CSF helps organizations to translate their
terminology for cybersecurity and cybersecurity risk management into general risk
management language that executives will understand.
NIST resources that describe the mutual relationship between cybersecurity risk management
and ERM include:
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 – Enterprise Risk Management Quick -Start Guide
- NIST Interagency Report 8286, Integrating Cybersecurity and Enterprise Risk
Management
- IR 8286A, Identifying and Estimating Cybersecurity Risk for E nterprise Risk Management
- IR 8286B, Prioritizing Cybersecurity Risk for Enterprise Risk Management
- IR 8286C , Staging Cybersecurity Risks for Enterprise Risk Management and Governance
Oversight
- IR 8286D, Using Business Impact Analysis to Inform Risk Prioritization and Response
- SP 800- 221, Enterprise Impact of Information and Communications Technology Risk:
Governing and Managing ICT Risk Programs Within an Enterprise Risk Portfolio
- SP 800- 221A, Informati on and Communications Technology Risk Outcomes:
Integrating ICT Risk Management Programs with the Enterprise Risk Portfolio
An organization may also find the CSF beneficial for integrating cybersecurity risk management
with individual ICT risk management programs , such as :
- Cybersecurity risk management and assessment : The CSF can be integrated with
established cybersecurity risk management and assessment programs , such as SP 80037, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations , and SP
800- 30, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments fr om the NIST Risk Management
Framework. For an organization using the NIST RMF and its suite of publications ,
the CSF can be used to complement the RMF’s approach to selecting and prioritizing
controls from SP 800 -5 3, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and
Organizations .
- Privacy risk s: While cybersecurity and privacy are independent disciplines, their
objectives overlap in certain circumstances, as illustrated in NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
Cybersecurity risk management is essential for addressing privacy risks related to the
loss of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of individuals’ data. For example,
data breaches could lead to identity theft. However, privacy risks can also arise by means that are unrelated to cybersecurity incidents .
An o rganization process es data to achieve mission or business purposes, which can
sometimes give rise to privacy events whereby individuals may experience problems as
a result of the data proces sing. The se problems can be expressed in various ways, but
NIST describes them as ranging from dignity -type effects (e.g., embarrassment or
stigma ) to more tangible harms (e.g., discrimination, economic loss, or physical harm) .
The NIST Privacy Framework a nd Cybersecurity Framework can be used together to
address the different aspects of cybersecurity and privacy risks. Additionally, NIST’s
Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology h as a catalog of example problems for
use in privacy risk assessment s.
- Suppl y chain risk s: An o rganization can use t he CSF to foster cybersecurity risk oversight
and communications with stakeholders across supply chains. All types of technology rely
on a complex, globally distributed, extensive, and interconnected supply chain
ecosystem with geographically diverse routes and multiple levels of outsourcing. This
ecosystem is composed of public - and private -sector entities (e.g., acquirers, suppliers,
developers, system integrators, external system service providers, and other technology -related service providers) that interact to research, develop, design,
manufacture, acquire, deliver, integrate, operate, maintain, dispose of, and otherwise utilize or manage technology products and services. These interactions are shaped and influenced by technologies, laws, policies, procedures, and practices.
Given the complex and interconnected relationships in this ecosystem , supply chain risk
management is critical for organizations. Cybersecurity SCRM (C- SCRM) is a
systematic process for managing exposure to cybersecurity risk throughout supply
chain s and developing appropriate response strategies, policies, processes, and
procedures. The Subcategories within the CSF C-SCRM Category [GV.SC] provide a
connection between outcomes that f ocus purely on cybersecurity and those that focus
NIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024
14 on C -SCRM . SP 800- 161r1 (Revision 1 ), Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management
Practices for Systems and Organizations , p rovides in -depth information on C -SCRM.
- Risks from emerging technologies: As new technologies and new applications of
technology become available, new risks become clear. A contemporary example is
artificial intelligence ( AI), which has cybersecurity and privacy risks, as well as many
other types of risk. The NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI
RMF) w as developed to help address the se risks. Treating AI risks along side other
enterprise risks (e.g., financial, cybersecurity, reputational, and privacy ) will yield a more
integrated outcome and organizational efficiencies. Cybersecurity and privacy risk management considerations and approaches are applicable to the design, development,
deployment, evaluation, and use of AI systems. The AI RMF Core uses Fu nctions,
Categories, and Subcategories to describe AI outcomes and help manage risks related to
AI.
