perplexing disputes about vaccines generally.10 The
last mile is long in every country.
Unequal, unjust access to Covid-19 vaccines is
one of many inequalities that have weighed heavily
throughout the pandemic. Indeed, those inequalities
have helped fuel its spread. The groups most likely to
be left behind have borne the brunt of its health and
economic risks. Women and girls have shouldered
even more household and caregiving responsibilities,
while violence against them has worsened (see chap ter in the full Report).11 Pre-existing digital divides
have widened gaps in children’s education access and
quality.12 Some fear a “lost generation” of learners.13
For people everywhere the Covid-19 pandemic
has generated questions without easy answers, fore most among them: When is this “over”? Answers
have proved fleeting, often dashed by upticks in cases
or the setting of new restrictions, forcing us back to
square one. Global supply chains remain stubborn ly knotted, contributing to inflation in all countries
— and in some, at rates not seen in decades.14 The
implications of unprecedented monetary and fiscal
interventions aiming to rescue ravaged economies,
many still scarred by the global financial crisis, re main largely uncertain. They unspool before us in
real time and alongside resurgent geopolitical ten sions. The pandemic is more than a virus, and it sim ply is not “over.”
With successive waves that have caught countries
flat-footed time and time again, ongoing mutability
and the seesawing of lockdowns, the Covid-19 pan demic and its seemingly endless twists and turns
have — perhaps above all else — entrenched a climate
of dogged uncertainty and unsettledness. And this
is just one pandemic, having emerged seemingly out
of nowhere, like a phantom that cannot be exorcised.
We were long warned about the threat of novel res piratory pathogens.15 As we move deeper into the An thropocene, we have been warned that there will be
more.
A new uncertainty complex is emerging
The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic on economies
pale beside the upheavals expected by powerful new
technologies and the hazards and transformations
they pose. What do investments in people’s education
and skills — a key part of human development — look like in the face of the disorienting pace of techno logical change, including automation and artificial
intelligence? Or in the face of deliberate, necessary
energy transitions that would restructure societies?
More broadly, amid unprecedented patterns of dan gerous planetary change, what capabilities matter
and how?
“ The impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic
on economies pale beside the upheavals
expected by powerful new technologies and
the hazards and transformations they pose
Recent years have seen more record temperatures,
fires and storms around the world, alarming remind ers that the climate crisis marches on, alongside other
planetary-level changes wrought by the Anthropo cene. Biodiversity collapse is one of them. More
than million plant and animal species face extinc tion.16 As much as the Covid-19 pandemic caught us
by surprise, unprepared and fumbling for paths for ward, we have even less of an idea of how to live in a
world without, say, an abundance of insects. That has
not been tried for about million years, when the
world’s first land plants appeared. This is not a coin cidence. Without an abundance of insect pollinators,
we face the mindboggling challenge of growing food
and other agricultural products at scale.
Human societies and ecological systems have long
influenced — and surprised — one another, but not
at the scales and speeds of the Anthropocene. Hu mans are now shaping planetary trajectories,17 and
the dramatically changing baselines — from global
temperatures to species diversity — are altering the
fundamental frame of reference humans have been
operating under for millennia. It is as if the ground
beneath our feet is shifting, introducing a new kind of
planetary uncertainty for which we have no real guide.
Material cycles, for example, have been upended.
For the first time in history, humanmade materials,
such as concrete and asphalt, outweigh the Earth’s
biomass. Microplastics are now everywhere: in coun try-sized garbage patches in the ocean, in protect ed forests and distant mountaintops and in people’s
lungs and blood.18 Mass coral bleaching is now com monplace rather than extraordinary.19
The latest International Panel on Climate Change
Report is a “code red for humanity.”20 While we still
have the possibility to prevent excessive global warm ing and avoid the worst scenarios, human-induced
changes to our planetary system are expected to con tinue well into the future. In essence, as science has
advanced, the models are, with better precision than
before, predicting more volatility.21
Any one of the rapid, planetary-level, human-in duced changes of the Anthropocene would be enough
on its own to inject frightening new uncertainties into
the fate of not just individuals, communities or even
nations, but of all humankind. Recall just a few dec ades ago when chlorofluorocarbons entered global
consciousness. Or the insecticide known as DDT be fore that. Or nuclear proliferation before that (and,
sadly, still today). The human-induced forces at work
in the Anthropocene are not atomized or neatly se quenced. They are not islands of perturbations in a
sea of relative stability. Instead, they are stacked on
top of each other, interacting and amplifying in un predictable ways. For the first time in human history,
anthropogenic existential threats loom larger than
those from natural hazards.22
“ The layering and interactions of
multidimensional risks and the overlapping
of threats give rise to new dimensions of
uncertainty, if for no other reason than human
choices have impacts well beyond our weakened
socioecological systems’ capacities to absorb them
For this reason, in its portraiture of uncertainty, the
Report does not build scenarios. Instead, it explores
how three novel sources of uncertainty at the global
level stack up to create a new uncertainty complex
that is unsettling lives and dragging on human devel opment (see chapter in the full Report):
- The first novel uncertainty is associated with the
Anthropocene’s dangerous planetary change and
its interaction with human inequalities.
- The second is the purposeful if uncertain transition
towards new ways of organizing industrial societies
— purporting transformations similar to those in the
transition from agricultural to industrial societies.23
- The third is the intensification of political and so cial polarization across and within countries — and
of misperceptions both about information and
across groups of people — facilitated by how new
digital technologies are often being used.24The layering and interactions of multidimensional
risks and the overlapping of threats give rise to new
dimensions of uncertainty, if for no other reason than
human choices have impacts well beyond our weak ened socioecological systems’ capacities to absorb
them. In this new uncertainty complex shocks can
amplify and interact rather than dissipate; they can
be propagated in systems rather than stabilized by
them.
Human pulsing of natural systems at unprecedent ed intensities and scales is one side of the uncertainty
coin. On the other are stubborn social deficits, in cluding deficits in human development, which make
it more difficult to navigate unpredictable outcomes
and to dial down those pulses in the first place. Con sider the Covid-19 pandemic, which has as much to
do with inequalities, poor leadership and distrust as
it does with variants and vaccines. Or competition
for environmental resources, competition that does
not typically break down into conflict. While stressed
ecosystems can parallel grievances, grievances be come conflicts due to social imbalances.25 Political
power, inequalities and marginalization contribute
more to environmental conflict than does access to
natural resources.
Political polarization complicates matters further
(figure 4). It has been on the rise, and uncertainty
makes it worse and is worsened by it (see chapter
in the full Report). Large numbers of people feel frus trated by and alienated from their political systems.26
In a reversal from just years ago, democratic back sliding is now the prevailing trend across countries.27
This despite high support globally for democracy.
Armed conflicts are also up, including outside socalled fragile contexts.28 For the first time ever, more
than million people are forcibly displaced, most
of them within their own countries.29
The conjunction of uncertainty and polarization
may be paralyzing — delaying action to curb human
pressures on the planet. The real paradox of our time
may be our inability to act, despite mounting evi dence of the distress that human planetary pressures
are causing ecological and social systems. Unless we
get a handle on the worrying state of human affairs,
we face the Anthropocene’s vicissitudes with one
hand tied behind our backs.
Even when functioning properly, conventional
crisis response and risk management mechanisms,
such as various forms of insurance, are not up to the
task of global, interconnected disruption. The unco ordinated responses to the Covid-19 pandemic are
a case in point. New strategies are needed for tail
events synchronized at the global level. Addressing
risk through diversification is difficult when volatili ty affects the entire system rather than only parts of
it. Yet, numerous countries around the world have
been steadily chipping away at risk sharing in many
ways.30 New forms of work and their uncertainties
have become more important in technology-enabled
gig economies. Altogether, insecurity has long been
on the rise.
And it has been on the rise for some groups more
than others. Against a backdrop of novel, interacting
uncertainties, people with power, wealth or privilege
have the means, to some degree, to protect them selves privately and to shift more of the burden on to
others. The groups most likely to be left behind face a world with complex new uncertainties in which most
of those uncertainties are directed at them, heaped
on persistent discrimination and human rights viola tions.31 It is not just that typhoons are getting bigger
and deadlier through human impact on the environ ment; it is also as if, through our social choices, their
destructive paths are being directed at the most vul nerable among us.
Feelings of distress are on the rise nearly everywhere
An analysis of more than million books published
over the last years in three major languages shows
a sharp increase in expressions of anxiety and worry
in many parts of the world (figure 5).32 Other research
on smaller time scales reports steady increases in
concerns about uncertainty since 2012, well before
the Covid-19 outbreak.330.00.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.0

means that polarization
increased from 2011 to 2021
Earlier this year, the United Nations Development
Programme’s Special Report on Human Security found
similarly troubling levels of perceived insecurity. Even
before the Covid-19 pandemic, more than in people
at the global level felt insecure.34 Perceived human in security is high across all Human Development Index
(HDI) groups, and it has increased, even in some very
high HDI countries (figure 6). Polarization has moved
in tandem in recent years. In parallel, there is a break down of trust: globally, fewer than percent of peo ple think that most people can be trusted, the lowest
value on record (see chapter in the full Report).
These and other data paint a puzzling picture in
which people’s perceptions about their lives and their
societies stand in stark contrast to historically high
measures of aggregate wellbeing, including long standing multidimensional measures of wellbeing,
such as the HDI and other indices that accompany
this Report. In sum, twin paradoxes: progress with in security and progress with polarization.
What is going on?
Too often the answer is reduced to fault-finding in quiries about whether the data or the people are wrong.
Most likely, neither. Although people tend to express a
holistic view of their lived experience, the questions asked about their lives often focus on specific, measur able subsets of that experience: years of schooling, life
expectancy, income. However important these metrics
are — and they are — they do not capture the totality of
a lived experience. Nor were they ever intended to re flect the full concept of human development, which
goes well beyond achievements in wellbeing, such as
reducing poverty or hunger, to include equally impor tant notions of freedoms and agency, which together
expand the sense of possibility in people’s lives. Nor do
individual achievements necessarily capture social co hesion and trust, which matter to people in their own
right and for working together towards shared goals. In
short, the twin paradoxes invite a hard look at narrow
conceptions of “progress.”
The 2019 Human Development Report empha sized going beyond averages to understand the wide
and growing variation in capabilities within many
countries. It identified widening gaps in enhanced
capabilities, such as access to higher education and
life expectancy at age 70, gaps that might also help
explain the apparent disconnect between what peo ple say about their lives and what we measure about
them. These are not either-or explanations; all are
possible, even probable.35English, United States

Capabilities face more volatile futures while becom ing ever more important for helping people navigate
the systemic uncertainties of a new epoch. Achieving
gains may become harder, securing them harder still.
Backsliding may become more sudden or common or
both; it has already become evident during the Covidpandemic. For the first time on record, the glob al HDI value declined, taking the world back to the
time just after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement.
Every year a few different countries experience dips in
their respective HDI values. But a whopping percent of countries saw their HDI value drop in either
2020 or 2021 (figure 7), far exceeding the number that
experienced reversals in the wake of the global finan cial crisis. Last year saw some recovery at the global
level, but it was partial and uneven: most very high
HDI countries notched improvements, while most of
the rest experienced ongoing declines (figure 8).
The goal of human development is to help people
lead lives they value by expanding their capabilities,
which go beyond wellbeing achievements to include agency and freedoms. If uncertainty forms storm
clouds over all aspects of human development, then it
hurls lightning bolts at the idea of agency. It can disem power. Choices mediate the translation of one’s values
and commitments into achievements, but the idea of
choice becomes ever more abstract, no matter how for mally educated or healthy we may be, if we doubt that
the choices we make will yield the outcomes we desire.
Losing perceived control rather than simply not having
it in the first place has its own negative consequences,
as do the knock-on effects: a tendency to identify cul prits or villains, a distrust of institutions and elites, and
greater insularity, nationalism and social discord. Un certainty can turn up the heat on a toxic brew.
Technology use is a double-edged sword
Powerful new technologies turn it up further. From
the news, products and advertisements served up
to us to the relationships we build online and in real
life, more and more of our lives are being determined Development Index (HDI) countries

by algorithms and, in particular, by artificial intel ligence. For people who are online, every aspect of
their lives becomes commodifiable data, raising wor rying questions about who has access to what infor mation, especially sensitive personal information,
and how it is being used.36
The political, commercial and personal all get mixed
together in social media, which is full of loud echo
chambers because they draw eyeballs, which draws advertising and other revenues. At least half the on line noise is from bots designed to stir the pot.37 Misin formation moves faster and farther than information
that has been subjected to reasoned scrutiny, sowing
distrust and fanning perhaps the gravest kind of un certainty: not knowing how to distinguish between
the two. Making the distinction goes beyond clear-cut
objectivism or the reliance on an agreed set of univer sal facts, scientific or otherwise. Motivated reasoning, countries enduring a decline in 2020 or 2021

in which people select facts, experts and other trusted
sources of information that confirm their already-held
beliefs, is widespread across political spectra and edu cation levels (see chapter in the full Report). Polariza tion can take dangerous forms when different groups
operate with entirely different sets of facts and, thus,
realities, especially when those realities are bound up
with group identities. Technologies then turn mere dis agreements into pitched battles for survival (see chap ter in the full Report).
Given the ways technology use can aggravate at the
societal level, its harmful effects at the community and
individual levels may come as no surprise. As it is in so
many parts of our lives, technology is a double-edged
sword. Artificial intelligence will both create and destroy
tasks, causing tremendous disruption. Synthetic biology
opens new frontiers in health and medicine while rais ing fundamental questions about what it means to be
human. From the invention of writing to Gutenberg’s
printing press to Marconi’s first radio transmissions,
technologies have been connecting people ever fast er in new ways, now instantaneously and across great
distances. Today, telemedicine is especially valuable
in digitally connected rural areas and has been vital for
mental and physical health during the pandemic.38
At the same time, rather paradoxically, technology
can isolate. Internet use has been found to reduce of fline interaction, political participation and various
forms of civic and cultural engagement.39 The con sequences of substituting the digital for the real are
complex and will be made more so as virtual worlds
— the metaverse — take up more real estate. Cyberbul lying is an issue on social media, and angry Twitter
mobs, mobilized sometimes by disinformation, can
digitally tar and feather someone faster than in real
life. Sometimes that spills over into real-life violence
or into real-life policy. Digital addiction is a real con cern. Random rewards in the form of likes on Insta gram or TikTok or the adrenaline rush of clickbait are
essentially cognitive hacks that lie at the heart of most
real-life casinos (see chapter in the full Report).40
Mental wellbeing is under assault
Mental wellbeing is an important, complex issue
globally without any single driver, technological or
otherwise. Mental distress, whose prevention is a critical aspect of overall mental wellbeing, is aggra vated by uncertainties and insecurities of all stripes:
by major Anthropocene phenomena, such as climate
change; by age-old scourges of discrimination, exclu sion, conflict and violence; and by relatively newer
entrants, such as social media and other technologies.
The uncertainties of the Anthropocene are expect ed to undermine people’s mental wellbeing through
four main pathways: traumatizing events, physical
illness, general climate anxiety and food insecurity
(see chapter in the full Report). The effects these
and other pathways have on children in particular
are profound, altering brain and body development,
especially in families on lower social rungs, poten tially diminishing what children can achieve in life.
The 2019 Human Development Report explored how
inequalities in human development are perpetuated
across generations;41 it is not difficult to see how the
confluence of mental distress, inequality and inse curity foment a similarly injurious intergenerational
cycle that drags on human development.
“ The uncertainties of the Anthropocene
are expected to undermine people’s mental
wellbeing through four main pathways:
traumatizing events, physical illness, general
climate anxiety and food insecurity
Violence — even the threat of violence, its
uncertainty — is a major driver of mental distress.
Some survivors of and witnesses to violence suffer
trauma, which if not addressed properly can devel op into post-traumatic stress disorder, among other
chronic health conditions, that can weigh heavily on
the choices available to them. Violence may be di rected at one person or group of people, but it affects
everybody in its blast radius. Even perpetrators of
violence can suffer trauma due to the violent setting
that often surrounds them, as with organized crime
or gang violence.42
The losses exacted by violence extend well beyond
direct physical, mental and emotional injury or trau ma. Violence can cause and exacerbate all kinds of
insecurities — food, economic and so forth — that are
themselves major drivers of mental distress. Many
kinds of violence, from interpersonal violence to or ganized crime to armed conflict, perniciously under mine trust in people we know and in people we do not
know. Breakdowns in trust may then beget more in stability, more violence.
“ Mental disorders weigh on human development
in many ways. A health issue themselves, they are
often linked to other health challenges. They can
impede school attendance and learning, as well
as the ability to find a job and be fully productive
at it. The stigma that often accompanies
mental disorders makes matters worse
Then there is the loss of agency due to violence. The
complex interplay of forces, rooted in asymmetries of
power, is powerfully at work in intimate partner vio lence, whose survivors are predominately women
and which is correlated with some measures of wom en’s economic dependence (see chapter in the full
Report). Channels of dominance at the societal and
institutional levels can take concentrated, wicked
forms — especially for women, children and older
people — behind what are meant to be the safe walls
of a home, leaving those subjected to domestic abuse
with either the perception or the reality of no escape.
The ensuing entrapment of people violates human
rights, constrains agency and ultimately undercuts
our collective ability to navigate a turbulent new era.
As it has been in so many ways, the Covid-19 pan demic is ominously illustrative. During the first year
of the pandemic, the global prevalence of depres sion and anxiety increased by more than percent.43
Low-income people, especially those who struggle
to afford basic needs such as rent and food, suffered
disproportionally in several countries.44 Women, who
assumed most of the additional domestic and care
work that emerged during school closures and lock downs,45 faced much higher mental distress than be fore the crisis.46
Stressors need not reach the level of globalized
trauma to cause mental distress. In fact, one of the
most serious economic threats to mental wellbeing
seems to stem from repeated financial shocks, such
as income loss, especially for poor people and for
men.47 Economic insecurity — or just the perception
of such insecurity, even if transitory — is a major fac tor. Mental distress is one reason why economic dis locations, whether from globalization or automation
or phasing out fossil fuels, carry some large, underap preciated risks.Mental disorders, such as post-traumatic stress
disorder and depression, can develop when men tal distress is severe and untreated. Almost billion
people — roughly one in eight of us — live with a men tal disorder,48 providing a lower-bound estimate of
the broader problem of mental distress. Globally,
mental health issues are the leading cause of disabil ity. Yet, of those who need mental health attention
or treatment, only about percent receive it.49 On
average, countries spend less than percent of their
healthcare budgets on mental health.50
Mental disorders weigh on human development in
many ways. A health issue themselves, they are often
linked to other health challenges. They can impede
school attendance and learning, as well as the abili ty to find a job and be fully productive at it. The stig ma that often accompanies mental disorders makes
matters worse. Mental disorders are uniquely chal lenging because the primary instrument to navigate
life’s challenges — the mind — is precisely the thing
that people living with a mental disorder may not be
able to rely on. The other thing we tend to rely on is
relationships. If those also suffer, people are left even
more isolated and vulnerable.
Purposeful transformations introduce
their own uncertainties
Today’s new uncertainty complex is not just about the
planetary pressures of the Anthropocene and politi cal and social polarization; it is also about purposeful
societal transformations that seek to ease planetary
pressures and leverage the positive potential of new
technologies (see chapter in the full Report). From
energy systems to food production to transportation,
easing planetary pressures demands fundamental
changes to much of the way the world currently oper ates. It is a necessary, wildly worthwhile investment
— ethically, environmentally, economically — but it
comes with its own significant uncertainties, espe cially for economies, livelihoods and pocketbooks.51
The energy transitions required to confront the cli mate crisis would be challenging even in the best of
times. They become more so when stacked on top of
inequalities and social fragmentation, the rapid clip
of technological disruption and dangerous planetary
change. The backlash in some countries to various
forms of energy taxation or carbon pricing is a case
in point. However welcome new renewable energy
technologies may be at competitive market prices,
they carry their own environmental costs and risks,
including those related to mining to supply the mate rials for the world’s solar panels and wind turbines.52
People rightly worry about winners and losers
when big change is on the horizon. Yes, the green
economy could add more than million jobs world wide by 2030.53 This is an exciting opportunity for
people and planet. But these jobs will not necessarily
be in the same regions that stand to lose jobs as fos sil fuel industries shut down. Nor will they require the
same skills as a fossil fuel–based economy. No one
seems especially interested in a bigger overall pie if
his or her piece is feared to be getting much smaller.
Nor do people need forecasts or history books to
know that societal transformations — however well
planned or not, however “good” or not — can radical ly reshape the communities they live in, often in un expected ways where “do-overs” are not possible if
things go wrong. Many around the world have lived
through transformations, some ongoing, in their life times. They see them with their own eyes. The trans formations in energy and materials required now in
the Anthropocene portend even more upheavals,
which some believe to be as large as the shift from ag ricultural to industrial societies.54
Whether it is the advent of agriculture or the In dustrial Revolution, previous tectonic shifts have
typically stretched across multiple generations. Now,
they can happen within a generation, in a matter of
years, introducing a new kind of uncertainty or worry.
Whether through foresight or experience, that will
influence how people think about and invest in their
lives, families and communities and hold their lead ers accountable. These are not reasons to give up on
a green economy; we cannot afford to throw in the
towel. But if we do not understand people’s pres ent and future anxieties and address the underlying
drivers, if we do not build trust and the promise of a
better future, progress towards purposeful, just, sus tainable transformations is going to be even harder.
The net result of today’s uncertainty complex on
development is profound. We might be facing a grow ing mismatch between what is needed to navigate
novel, interacting uncertainties and the current state
of affairs, categorized by social arrangements (what to do — in terms of policies, institutions) and the behav iours shaped by social context, culture and narratives
(how to do it — in terms of prevalent identities, values
and beliefs). The interplay of forces — their scales,
speeds, unknown interactions and consequences —
have made development pathways simultaneously
far less obvious and far more open. What should hap pen next can no longer be taken for granted. A line ar march of progress in which low-income countries
chase higher income ones is less relevant. In a sense
all countries are developing countries, charting a new
planetary course together, regardless of whether they
work together to do so.
“ In a sense all countries are developing countries,
charting a new planetary course together,
regardless of whether they work together to do so
The question is no longer simply how some coun tries get from point A to point B; instead, it is how
all countries start moving from wherever they are to
points N, T or W — or letters in some new alphabet —
and then course correct along the way. Development
is perhaps better seen as a process characterized both
by adapting to an unfolding unknown reality and by
purposefully transforming economies and societies
to ease planetary pressures and advance inclusion.55
There is promise and opportunity in uncertainty
If necessity is the mother of invention, then the very
forces that give rise to today’s uncertainties also offer
the means to navigate them. Uncertainty engenders
the possibility of change, also for the better. Consider
artificial intelligence, a disruptive opportunity at least
as much as a disruptive threat. Its potential for enhanc ing labour is bigger than its potential for automating
it. New tasks, new jobs, new industries are all possi ble (figure 9). Recall that most jobs came into being in
part through the task-creating effects of new technolo gies: around percent of people in the United States
are now employed in occupations that did not exist in
1940.56 We do not, however, have the luxury to wait
around for the long run. The negative displacement
impacts of artificial intelligence are too big, too likely
and too fast, especially if labour-replacing incentives
dominate its development. Policies and institutions
must be put into place that nudge artificial intelligence
towards people rather than away from them, to unlock
and frontload its potential for positive transformation.
We are already witnessing artificial intelligence’s
upside in many areas (see chapter in the full Re port). Among its many climate-related applications,
it aids in modelling climate change impacts and in
predicting disasters. In education it can facilitate in dividualized learning and enhance accessibility. In
biology it has revolutionized protein folding predic tion, a huge boon for medicine.57
Among the many things the Covid-19 pandemic
broke open was our imaginations. It expanded the
reference points for what is possible (see chapter
in the full Report). Consider the rapid development
and distribution in many (but not all) countries of
safe, effective Covid-19 vaccines, some based on new
mRNA technologies that hold promise for preventing
and treating many other diseases. The pandemic nor malized paid sick leave, voluntary social distancing
and self-isolation, all important for our response to
future pandemics.
The interventions by central banks over the past
two years dwarf their interventions in the wake of the
global financial crisis about a decade earlier. Fiscal policy saw a sea change, too. Social protection has
surged, protecting many people from even worse
impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic while providing
large-scale test cases of innovative ideas: linking na tional registries and databases for eligibility determi nation; expanding coverage to previously uncovered
beneficiaries, such as refugees, migrants and infor mal workers; and adopting digital verification and de livery systems, among other pathbreaking steps.58
Civil society has been breaking new ground, too. In
many places the Covid-19 pandemic galvanized civil
society organizations to deliver emergency respons es, in some cases taking on new functions.59 In re sponse to expanded emergency government powers,
some civil society entities have beefed up watchdog
activities, and still others are pushing to address so cial, economic and political imbalances laid bare by
the pandemic.
As the Covid-19 pandemic has shown, the growing
mismatch between the world as it is (or is becoming)
and conventional ways of understanding and doing
things, such that more and more of life lacks an ob vious compass or structure, can be seen as an oppor tunity to do something new. It can be an opportunity
to imagine, experiment and create, in ways similar to Tasks that
humans can doHuman tasks that could be automated
New tasks that
humans can do with
the help of machines
the work of a scientist or artist. Existing institutions
can be transformed, and new ones created, alongside
new leaders, social movements and norms. Much like
many scientists and artists, who are often responding
to practical personal and societal concerns, this pro cess of ongoing, creative reconstruction at all levels
is a practical response to today’s uncertainty com plex. We will have to find ways to renew, adapt and
create institutions in the face of their inevitable short comings in an unpredictably changing world. We will
have to experiment, to cooperate, in order to thrive.
If we do not — if we reinforce the status quo, when
the status quo is part of the problem, or limit our as pirations to a “return to normal” — the gap between
a changing world and intractable norms and institu tions will widen to a chasm. Opportunities for inno vation and good leadership then increasingly become
dangerous vacuums in power where the allure of sim ple recipes and the easy gratifications of finger point ing combine to make the problem worse. There is
promise and peril in uncertainty and disruption; tip ping the scales towards promise — towards hope — is
up to us.
An evolving portfolio of perspectives
helps in a world of worry
Tipping the scales towards promise requires that we
keep testing the fences of conventional thinking, to
embrace an evolving portfolio of perspectives from
which to draw, mixing and matching as emerging
contexts require. For instance, policies and institu tions at all levels need to go beyond assuming that
people are only, or even predominantly, self-interest ed (see chapter in the full Report). This assumption
remains highly relevant, but it is does not encompass
the totality of human behaviour. Its limitations have
been highlighted and addressed, at least partially, by
complementary and pioneering work in behavioural
economics. Still, we must reach for broader perspec tives of human decisionmaking, ones that consider
the roles of emotions and culture and that explore
how people weave together and change value-infused
narratives about themselves and the various commu nities they belong to. For example, our relationship
with nature needs renovation, and cultural narratives
are the foundation.“ To respond creatively and nimbly to
today’s uncertainty complex, we need to
bring down barriers to people’s imaginations,
identities and networks, to expand the
idea of what is possible in people’s lives
Just as we must widen the vista on human behav iour, notions of human development must go beyond
a focus on wellbeing achievements, however impor tant they still are, to include the vital roles of agency
and freedoms in helping people live lives that they
value (see chapter in the full Report). Doing so illu minates the apparent paradoxes of our age: progress
with insecurity and progress with polarization. A com prehensive embrace of human development can act as
a lodestar through turbulent times when cookie-cut ter policy lists simply will not do. To respond crea tively and nimbly to today’s uncertainty complex, we
need to bring down barriers to people’s imaginations,
identities and networks, to expand the idea of what is
possible in people’s lives. While crises can present op portunities for pathbreaking action, we will be better
off operating deliberately and proactively rather than
in a chronic state of emergency response. In an age of
layered and interacting uncertainties, freedoms may
not translate reliably into desired achievements or
outcomes. That is the unfortunate news. But individ uals, families and communities can be empowered to
experiment, to try new things, for their benefit and for
others, without fear of being trapped in poverty, in a
single identity or in one cultural narrative.
Rigidities in their many dimensions — in ideas, in
networks, in narratives — act as a vise on human cre ativity; they constrain the generation of new ideas
in response to a changing world. Agency and free doms are antidotes. Policies, institutions and cultural
change that promote them tend to be fostered by cul tivating four motivating principles: flexibility, solidar ity, creativity and inclusion (see also chapter in the
full Report). These principles, which can reinforce
one another, will go a long way in making policies and
institutions more fit for purpose.
The four principles can also have their own inter nal tensions. Building systems with some stabilizing
redundancies, for example, needs to be balanced
against nimble response capacities. Still, it is hard
to be quick on one’s feet if one is constantly getting
knocked over by a financial meltdown, novel virus or
monster hurricane. Similarly, there is a give and take
to creative exploration and concerted, purposeful
action anchored in human rights. Striking the right
balance among the four motivating principles will be
key, and trust is essential to doing so. People will be
suspicious of the negotiation table if they fear that the
chair will be constantly jerked out from under them.
Policy development will be an iterative, trial-and-er ror process in which we must all learn from each
other.
Policies and institutions to invest, insure and innovate
There are no policy panaceas, no one-size-fits-all
approaches. Even so, some policies form the build ing blocks for countries and communities as they
navigate today’s uncertainty complex towards more
hopeful futures. They fall into three overlapping, mu tually reinforcing categories: investment, insurance
and innovation — the Three I’s (figure 10; see also
chapter in the full Report).
Investment should connect the dots. Nature-based
human development can protect and enhance natural
resources while protecting people from shocks, pro moting economic and food security and expanding
the choices available to them. Such investments are
especially relevant at the local level, speaking to the need for investing in governance that is connected to
people on the ground, that builds bridges among pol icy and institutional silos and that ensures all voices
are heard. Investments are needed, too, on the other
end — in global public goods. The new uncertain ty complex is often driven by global phenomena, so
responding to it can require global cooperation. The
additional investment to avoid future pandemics is
estimated to be only $15 billion a year.60 This is a tiny
fraction of the economic cost of the Covid-19 pan demic, a cost that exceeds $7 trillion in lost produc tion and $16.9 trillion in emergency fiscal responses.61
Investments in global pandemic preparedness make
good sense, given the devastating human costs.
Insurance provides an essential stabilizing force
in the face of uncertainty. To start, structures that
manage a variety of risk in people’s lives, primarily
in various forms of social protection, need to be re vitalized and modernized, including for people in in formal or other precarious employment, such as gig
workers. We need to reverse course away from risk
segmentation and move towards a broader sharing of
risk. More countercyclical social protection measures
can be automatically triggered by certain indicators,
such as the loss of a job or a drop in income, while
ensuring their inclusivity. Such measures played im portant roles in many countries in protecting people
from some of the worst impacts of the global financial

crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. One of the bene fits of automatic triggers is that they require less polit ical wrangling at already stressful moments, helping
target political capital to the unique features of a new
challenge rather than continually plugging holes in
leaky safety nets.
Universal basic services, such as health and edu cation, are important investments in their own right,
as evidenced in the Sustainable Development Goals,
and for inclusively expanding human development.
They also afford an important insurance function,
helping stabilize people in the face of seemingly re lentless shocks. This can encourage experimentation.
People are loath to try new things if doing so risks
their or their family’s health and education and
threatens to yank them irreversibly down a yawning
socioeconomic ladder.
“ Innovation will be at the heart of
successfully navigating the many unforeseen,
unknowable challenges ahead
Investments in preparedness, not just for shocks
but also for societal transitions, can be well worth the
cost. Equally important are investments in promot ing and protecting human rights and in deliberative
mechanisms that enable public reasoning in a par ticipatory, inclusive way. Together they help insure
against polarization.
Innovation will be at the heart of successfully navi gating the many unforeseen, unknowable challenges
ahead. Some readymade tools will help, others will be
modified and updated for new contexts and still oth ers will be built from scratch. In part, innovation has
to do with new technologies and ensuring that they
reach everyone. Computational capacities amount ing to millions of Apollo missions to the moon are
now in the hands of everyone with a smartphone,
which is just about everybody.62 In developing coun tries mobile phones have reshaped financial transfers
and access to information, such as weather forecasts
and wholesale market prices. New insurance models
are needed that respond to complex new risk para digms: risks that are increasingly synchronized across
geographies and sectors, that span generations and
that harm natural resources.
The “right” role for governments in innovation is
an important question, and governments have big roles in fostering climates for innovation. There was
widespread support when governments threw their
full weight behind Covid-19 vaccines, committing
to staggering prepurchase orders of then-unprov en technologies. Governments were a driving force
and active development and distribution partner
throughout, ushering in and deploying a lifesaving
new technology at astonishing speed. (The contrast
with the relatively anaemic action on climate change,
no less an emergency than Covid-19, is stark.) Inno vation policy frameworks, which are intimately tied
to other areas such as competition and patent laws,
have enormous implications across sectors, from
access to medicines and energy to food and water
security.
Innovation does not have to be big to produce big
results. Major social media platforms have enact ed policies such as notices, warnings and links to
resources in a bid to combat misinformation. For
example, links to official information by the World
Health Organization are suggested under posts men tioning Covid-19 on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube
and TikTok. Twitter reminds users when they are
sharing an article without opening the link first (see
chapter in the full Report). Fact-checking initiatives
have been created by users on these same platforms,
and media plurality has been strengthened through
new and independent outlets that could not exist or
have the means to inform in the traditional media
landscape, often at the local and grassroot levels.
Governments can also take prudent steps to combat
misinformation while respecting and promoting peo ple’s human rights and freedoms.
Sometimes the answer might not be complex. The
simple addition of the retweet button on Twitter has
enabled information, including misinformation, to go
viral. Modifying its use, as some have argued, could
go a long way in curbing some of the more troubling
features of social media.63 Course correcting in this
way — practical solutions to practical problems — will
be key to navigating the new uncertainty complex.
Innovation is more than technologies as we un derstand them conventionally in terms of vaccines
or smartphones. Equally important is social innova tion, which is a whole-of-society endeavour. Adap tive peacebuilding, which focuses on emergent
bottom-up, participatory processes rather than ad hering to a set recipe, is a case in point.64 Much can be
learned from its application in Rwanda for healing,
transitional justice and conflict resolution (see chap ter in the full Report).
Cultural change opens opportunities for collective action
Policies and institutions are embedded in social con texts, so aspects such as narratives matter a lot, too.
Everyone is immersed in social contexts, with cul ture understood not as a fixed variable working in the
background but as a toolkit that changes over time
and that individuals and groups use strategically in
society.
When it comes to choices about the future, people
appear to be motivated less by accurate scenarios of
what the future may hold than by collectively held
narratives.65 Much of the current information about
the future, in the form of assessments, such as those
issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change or Intergovernmental Science-Policy Plat form on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services,66 are
anticipatory. As crucial as they are, it is important to
consider also having assessments towards imagining
more desirable futures.67
The importance of culture is finding its way into
many other areas, including economics and law. The
work of Robert Shiller explains dynamics in asset
prices as well as business cycles in terms of “narrative
economics.”68 Karla Hoff and James Walsh suggest
that law affects behaviour not only by changing in centives and information (a coordination function) or
through its expressive role (as a guidepost for social
norms) but also with the potential to change cultural
categories.69
Shifting culture, for good or ill, is possible and can
happen quickly. Education can be a powerful tool to
open the potential for new perspectives in younger
generations, not just through curricula but also by en visaging schools as spaces of inclusion and diversity.
Social recognition by elites of all types, from politi cians and celebrities to social media influencers and
community leaders, is an important mechanism for
cultural change. Media in its many forms plays a big
role here. In Bangladesh a popular animated televi sion show reduced the cultural and religious stigma
of girls going to school in rural areas and increased
their attendance.70 In Ghana and Kenya the Time to Change campaign made inroads into reducing men tal health stigma.71
The issue is not just about recipients of pro grammes or target audiences but also about who is
deciding on and delivering the messages. For exam ple, women’s representation in political bodies shifts
policy priorities and expands aspirations for other
women and girls. Social movements have important
roles as well in advancing human rights and changing
cultural norms and narratives to expand agency and
freedoms (see chapter in the full Report).
“ Walls between our social connections
are perhaps more insidiously damaging and
polarizing than walls between nations
Essential to flexible and adaptable narratives, in
building trust and social cohesion for more hopeful
futures, is the freedom for each person to have and
move among different identities in different social
contexts (see chapter in the full Report).72 Walls be tween our social connections are perhaps more insid iously damaging and polarizing than walls between
nations. The bridges that connect different groups are
among our most important assets. Good leaders re habilitate and strengthen them and help us use them
— especially in the face of unknowns. Demagogues
try to burn them down, replacing fluid connection,
exchange and learning with zero-sum, us-versusthem narratives. Instead of trying out cultural scripts
precisely when experimentation matters most, peo ple become trapped by them.
Where we go from here is up to us
We must learn to live with today’s uncertainty com plex, just as we must learn to live with Covid-19. This
year’s Human Development Report challenges us to
aspire to more than mere accommodation, however.
By unlocking our human potential, by tapping into
our creativity and diversity anchored in trust and sol idarity, it challenges us to imagine and create futures
in which we thrive. The encouraging words of the
late, great poet and civil rights activist Maya Angelou
ring as true as ever, reminding us “to bring all our en ergies to each encounter, to remain flexible enough to
notice and admit when what we expected to happen
did not happen. We need to remember that we are
created creative and can invent new scenarios as fre quently as they are needed.”73
Where we go from here is up to us. One of the great
lessons of our species’ history is that we can accom plish a lot with very little if we work together towards
shared goals. If there is a secret ingredient to human
magic, that must be it. The challenges in the Anthro pocene and in sweeping societal transformations are
huge, even daunting, all the more so for countries and
communities struggling with the most dramatic and
unjust deprivations. Insecurity and polarization make things worse. Amid so much uncertainty, the truth is
that we are not going to get it right, maybe not even
most of the time. In this turbulent new era we can
set the direction but cannot guarantee the outcome.
The good news is that we have more tools than ever to
help us navigate and course correct. But no amount of
technological wizardry is a substitute for good lead ership, collective action or trust. If we can start fixing
the human side of the planetary ledger — and this Re port tries to highlight how — then the future, however
uncertain, will be more promise than peril, just as it
should be.
