13globally and within countries at national and subnational levels,
that will contribute to building an internationally connected digital
health system with consideration of potential risks. It aims to
encourage international collaboration and to support countries in
their national programmes towards improved health care service
delivery, implementing national health strategies, promoting research
and development and working towards achieving universal health
coverage and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals.
The global strategy will lead to concrete actions and results within the
time frame from 2020 to 2025.Global strategy on digital health 2020-2025 PURPOSE
15Acknowledge that institutionalization of digital health in the
national health system requires a decision and commitment
by countries
The global strategy acknowledges that each country owns its digital
health action plan built on the strategy, within its own national
context. Along their path towards the health-related Sustainable
Development Goals, countries will adopt digital health in a way that
is sustainable, respects their sovereignty, and best suits their culture
and values, national health policy, vision, goals, health and well-being
needs, and available resources.
Recognize that successful digital health initiatives require an
integrated strategy
Digital technologies are an essential component and an enabler
of sustainable health systems and universal health coverage. To
realize their potential, digital health initiatives must be part of the
wider health needs and the digital health ecosystem and guided by
a robust strategy that integrates leadership, financial, organizational,
human and technological resources and is used as the basis for a
costed action plan which enables coordination among multiple
stakeholders. These initiatives should be led through strong
governance structures. The strategy should address an approach that
will work across multiple health priorities underpinned by standards
and an architecture that enables this integration.
Historical review shows that ill-coordinated or disjoined digital
health initiatives lead to vertical or stand- alone information and
communications technology solutions that, although well-intended,
often result in information fragmentation and, consequently, poor
delivery of services.

# Guiding Principles

The four guiding principles aim to orient the global strategy towards the
appropriate and sustainable adoption of digital health technologies within
the context of national health sector and health strategies.16Promote the appropriate use of digital technologies for health
The global strategy promotes the appropriate use of digital
technologies as digital public goods which are adaptable to different
countries and contexts to help address key health system challenges
to support equity in access to digital resources so that no one is
left behind. It promotes the protection of people, populations,
health care professionals and systems against misinformation and
the misuse of information, malicious cyber activities, fraud and
exploitation, inappropriate use of health data, racism and human
rights violations within the framework established by international
treaties binding the Member States.
The “digital determinants of health” , such as literacy in information
and communication technologies and access to equipment,
broadband and the internet, become more important as digital
health becomes more prevalent. The global strategy underscores the
need to ground digital foundations within national strategies and
emphasizes the need to work with different sectors and stakeholders
at all levels.
The global strategy promotes syntactic and semantic interoperability
with WHO norms and standards as a cornerstone of health
information to enable sharing of information in a connected world.
The appropriate use of digital health takes the following dimensions
into consideration: health promotion and disease prevention, patient
safety, ethics, interoperability, intellectual property, data security
(confidentiality, integrity, and availability), privacy, cost-effectiveness,
patient engagement, and affordability. It should be people-centred,
trust-based, evidence-based, effective, efficient, sustainable,
inclusive, equitable and contextualized. The growing global challenge
of digital waste on health and the environment must also be
appropriately managed.3
17Recognize the urgent need to address the major impediments
faced by least-developed countries implementing digital
health technologies
There is a pressing need to invest in efforts to overcome the major
impediments that developing countries face in engaging with and
accessing new digital health technologies, such as an appropriate
enabling environment, sufficient resources, infrastructure to support
the digital transformation, education, human capacity, financial
investment and internet connectivity, as well as issues related to
legacy infrastructure, technology ownership, privacy, security, and
adapting and implementing global standards and technology flows.4
knowledge on digital health
This strategic objective aims to align countries and stakeholders to
collectively act upon global opportunities to improve health and
work towards universal health coverage, while meeting challenges,
identifying and communicating risks, and focusing on threats
associated with the use of digital technologies both to improve health
and to enable universal health coverage, the core of the healthrelated Sustainable Development Goals. This objective encourages
action on common opportunities and challenges that are relevant to
all countries and stakeholders, regardless of their situation.
Maximize the impact of both new and existing collaborations and
partnerships in the wider digital health ecosystem. Knowledge of and
investments in digital health design and implementation are shared
across domains; hence this strategic objective aims to maximize
collaborations and partnerships with other agencies within the
United Nations system, countries and other stakeholders and to help
to build new ones.
Assess and promote the latest, appropriate and innovative health
technologies. Pioneering health technologies are creating new and
advanced health care services and solutions. This sub-objective
helps to ensure that the quality and outcome of the new health
technologies are assessed in order to enable their timely adoption
and promotion. Norms, standards, policies and regulations are
needed to ensure the investment, sustainability, quality, security
and safety of both digital health products and cutting-edge health
technologies that not only are used in health care but that may also
be directly marketed to individuals. Global guidance, coordination

# Strategic Objectives

The four strategic objectives are intended to provide guidance and
coordination on global digital health transformation and to strengthen
synergies between initiatives and stakeholders to improve health
outcomes and mitigate associated risks at all levels.

## Collaboration and knowledge transfer

20Policy options and actions
The following policy options and actions are proposed:
- co-create the global strategy on digital health and establish
mechanisms for strengthening national digital health strategies
and implementing key collaborations on agreed-upon
appropriate use of digital technologies to achieve national health
and well-being goals;
- establish a knowledge management approach to identify and
share good practices, knowledge about implementation of new
methods and techniques, evidence and lessons learned on digital
health across countries and international communities;
- support countries in establishing information centres for disease
surveillance to manage and implement timely decisions during
epidemics and other public health emergencies;
- align countries and stakeholders to address collectively global,
regional and national challenges and opportunities; identify,
manage and communicate risks; and mitigate threats associated
with the use of digital technologies to improve health and
enable universal health coverage, the core of the health- related
Sustainable Development Goals.
Outputs
The following outputs are envisaged:
- digital health is prioritized and integrated into health systems at
global, regional and national levels through dedicated bodies
and mechanisms for governance;
- multistakeholder groups are convened on a regular
basis to support the appropriate use and scaling up of digital
health and innovation in order to accelerate progress towards the
health-related Sustainable Development Goals; and implementation of tools are required for their adoption and
integration into existing systems and services at the national level.
- information centres for disease surveillance are established or
strengthened at national, regional and global levels.
Advance the implementation of national digital health
strategies
Strategic objective 2 aims to stimulate and support every country to
own, adapt and strengthen its strategy on digital health in a way that
best suits its vision, national context, health situation and trends,
available resources and core values.
Strategic objective 2 encourages the development of a national
strategy on digital health through an all- inclusive multistakeholder
approach including actors collaborating within communities of
practice and with consideration to the following core components:
(1) leadership and governance; (2) investment and operations;
(3) services and applications for scaling up (4) integration and
sustainability, while (5) standards and interoperability are respected;
(6) a flexible digital infrastructure; (7) an adaptable health workforce
and (8) legislation, ethics policies and compliance; and (9) a peoplecentred approach. These should all be developed while the necessary
alignment of country stakeholders is ensured in order that the needs
and expectations with given resources be met.
The strategic objective aims to develop cross-sectoral partnerships
at national level to align resources and investments to ensure the
sustainability and growth of digital health. The objective also seeks to
work with existing digital health partnerships to advance global digital
health efforts. Developing national partnerships for the sustainability
of digital health advances would accelerate their adoption by
Member States.
Although each country is expected to review or develop and own its
strategy from inception to implementation, this strategic objective
aims to build human and institutional capacity for the safe and
appropriate use and scale-up of digital health by strengthening the
commitment and systematic engagement of all stakeholders in
every country. The objective underpins the promotion of innovative
integration of digital technologies into health systems.Digital strategy implementation

## 22To strengthen health systems by introducing digital technologies,

a key objective is to find ways to build capacity and create a
digitally-capable health workforce. Needs will vary from country to
country, but they often include basic capacities, such as leadership
and governance, and the development of a skilled health and
technological workforce.
Policy options and actions
The following policy options and actions are proposed:
- stimulate and support every country to adopt or review, own,
and strengthen its national digital health strategy in a way that
enhances the level of country maturity regarding digital health to
achieve positive health outcomes in line with the national health
plans, updated norms and standards recommendations, and
universal health coverage;
- ensure that institutions, decision-makers and personnel
involved in the provision of health care services and all enduser communities and beneficiary populations are adequately
engaged in the design and development phases;
- facilitate a systematic engagement of all relevant stakeholders in
the realization of the vision and its strategic objectives as part of
an integrated digital health ecosystem at the national level;
- define a national digital health architecture blueprint or road
map, adopt open-source health data standards and aim for
reusable systems or assets including interoperability of health
information systems both at national and international levels in
order to establish an innovative integration of different digital
technologies using shared services, ensuring data are of good
and comparable quality;
- adopt legal and ethical frameworks for assuring patient safety,
data security, appropriate use and ownership of health data,
privacy data recoverability, as well as protection of intellectual
property rights;
- identify and promote sustainable financing models in
support of digital health development and sharing of learning
to inform future products and services. This is especially
important in artificial intelligence including machine learning,
implementation, integration and maintenance, including
economic incentives; and
- design, implement and monitor a change management plan, to
support conducive organizational behaviour surrounding newly
digitized health processes and practices.
Outputs
The following outputs are envisaged:
- a national digital health strategy or equivalent strategic
framework exists, is integrated in the national health strategy
and is actively used to guide development and accelerate
progress towards the health-related targets of the Sustainable
Development Goals and in the context of digital transformation of
health systems; and
- a dynamic digital health maturity model assessment to guide
prioritization of national investment in digital health is made in
support of primary health care and universal health coverage.
Strengthen governance for digital health at global, regional and
national levels
This strategic objective focuses on strengthening the governance of
digital health at national and international levels through the creation
of sustainable and robust governance structures and building the
capacity for digital health at global and national levels. Governance
for digital health aims to strengthen the capabilities and skills
needed for countries to promote, innovate and scale up digital
health technologies.
The strategic objective promotes standards for safety, security,
privacy, interoperability, and the ethical use of data within and
outside the health sector. Actions to strengthen governance Digital health governance

## 24should include defining principles and reaching cross-sectoral and

international agreements for data sharing, quality and accuracy
of health data and prioritization of investment plans and policy. It
should also include principles for the ethical use of health data in
technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics.
It also aims to improve measurement and monitoring of and research
on the application of digital health in the health sector. The research
agenda should meet the need to improve and disseminate evidence
and information on the use of digital health at all levels. Research on
and evaluation of digital health outcomes and impact are essential
to support its safe implementation, to establish and promote
accountability and to justify the financial investment. The agenda
should also address the need to stimulate the development and
testing of technologies, methods and infrastructures that overcome
obstacles to the application of digital health to health priorities. This
agenda is closely linked to capacity-building of research teams and
the improvement and sharing of methods and data analytics.
Policy options and actions
The following policy options and actions are proposed:
- strengthen governance of digital health at national and
international levels by leveraging existing structures and as
appropriate creating sustainable and robust governance
structures, including regulatory frameworks, and the capacity for
the implementation of evidence-based and proven digital health
solutions at global and national levels;
- coordinate investments in evidence-based approaches to
assess promote and disseminate new and innovative health
technologies for national scaled digital health programmes using
a person-centred approach to facilitate actions and investments
based on informed decisions;
- promote and facilitate digital health competencies in the
education and training curricula of all health professionals and
allied workers; and 254) promote capacity-building for leaders of public health
authorities, affiliated agencies and policy-makers to take
informed decisions to support digital health investments.
Outputs
The following outputs are envisaged:
- governance exists, in accordance with Secretariat-led
development of regulatory framework, to agree on global
appropriate use of health data and on concepts such as health
data as a global public good and to outline principles of equitable
data-sharing principles for research, consistent metadata and
definitions, artificial intelligence and data analytics, and primary
and secondary use of data;
- a voluntary guideline on global interoperability standards for
digital health is developed in collaboration with stakeholders
and adopted, that a) tries to build upon results already broadly
achieved, b) includes a list of commonly agreed use cases for the
public health care sector, its functional requirements and a set
of functional and technical specifications, standards, semantics
and profiles derived thereof, c) defines requirements for a sound
legal and regulatory framework with clearly defined roles for data
governance and d) encompasses political leadership regarding
public investment, procurement and standardization to create
an interoperable digital health ecosystem at the national and
international levels;
- global guidance on planning, development and use of digital
hospitals, digital clinical trials and digital therapeutics is
developed; and
- a set of recommendations is developed for pseudonymization
and anonymization of health data.26Advocate people-centred health systems that are enabled by
digital health
This strategic objective advances digital health literacy, gender
equality and women’ s empowerment and inclusive approaches to
adoption and management of digital health technologies.
The strategic objective places people at the centre of digital health
through the adoption and use of digital health technologies in scaling
up and strengthening health service delivery. The individual is an
essential component in the delivery of trust-based, people-centred
care. This focus covers not only patients, families and communities
but also the health workers who need to be prepared to deploy or
use digital health technologies in their work. Planning for capacitybuilding includes workforce assessment, ranging from professionals
in information and communication technologies to health workers
providing care services. Being intrinsically multidisciplinary and
interdisciplinary, capacity-building entails instilling capabilities,
attitudes and skills which may range from computer sciences,
strategic planning, finance and management to health sciences
and care delivery, depending on the digital health application and
its context. Assessment of the workforce should also consider the
implications for the health labour market of introducing digital
technologies and their management. This objective would call for
countries to move away from the current disease focused systems to
an integrated approach with the patient at the centre.
Attitudes to, practices in and public awareness of digital health
should also be addressed. Possible actions include improving digital
health literacy at the population level, engagement of patients,
families and communities, and education of patients about health.
Better responding to the social and commercial determinants of
health to improve digital health-enabled health systems will need the
engagement of civil society but also non-health sectors and actors.
Increasing awareness of evidence based self-management tools and
increasing access to these is a further action to consider.Human-centre d health systems

## 27Policy options and actions

The following policy options and actions are proposed:
- place people at the centre of digital health through the
appropriate health data ownership, adoption and use of digital
health technologies and development of appropriate literacy; the
focus will cover not only patients, families and communities but
also health workers;
- develop approaches to the management of health at the
population level through digital health applications that move
health and well-being from reactive-care models to active
community-based models, and reduce the burden of data
collection from front-line workers by reorienting reporting-based
tools into service delivery tools;
- establish monitoring and evaluation models to facilitate
monitoring the contribution of digital systems to health system
processes, health workforce processes, and individual and
community health needs;
- strengthen gender equality and health equity approaches and
accessibility for people with disabilities to promote inclusive
digital society with enhanced digital health skills. When planning
and prioritizing digital health interventions, relevant factors
of inequality should be assessed in order to ensure that the
introduction of digital health technologies does not aggravate
these ( “do no harm” ) and that access for specific population
groups is guaranteed. In addition, the specific potential of digital
technologies to promote health equity should be leveraged.
Designed properly, digital solutions can propel inclusiveness as
digital connectivity can transcend physical barriers;
- implement mechanisms for more effective public participation
and transparency in national and international digital health
decision-making processes, such as through international
consultation processes or a stakeholder forum;
- develop digital health training or Massive Open Online Courses to
improve digital health literacy; and
