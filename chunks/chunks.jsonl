project at IBM, which culminated with the Deep Blue\nprogram beating Garry Kasparov, then the world chess champion, by a score of\n3.5-2.5 in 1997.\n\nCuriously , no sooner had AI caught up with its elusive target than\nDeep Blue was portrayed as a collection of “brute force methods” that wasn’t “real\nintelligence.”8 In fact, IBM’s subsequent publication about Deep Blue, which gives\nextensive

intelligence.10 Though the advent of AI has depended\non the rapid progress of hardware computing resources, the focus here on\nsoftware reflects a trend in the AI community .\n\nMore recently ,

and\ngenerality.\n\n14tighter coupling between hardware and software in advancing AI.\n\n“Intelligence” remains a complex phenomenon whose varied aspects have attracted\nthe attention of several different fields of study , including psychology , economics,\nneuroscience, biology , engineering, statistics, and linguistics.\n\nNaturally , the field of AI has\nbenefited from the progress made by all of these allied fields.\n\nFor example, the artificial\nneural network, which has been at the heart of several AI-based solutions12 was\noriginally inspired by thoughts about the flow of information in biological neurons.14\nAI RESEARCH TRENDS\nUntil the turn of the millennium, AI’s appeal lay largely in its promise to deliver, but\nin the last fifteen years, much of that promise has been redeemed.15 AI technologies\nalready pervade our lives.\n\nAs they becomes a central force in society , the field is\nshifting from simply building systems that are intelligent to building intelligent systems\nthat are human-aware and trustworthy .\n\nSeveral factors have fueled the AI revolution.\n\nForemost among them is the\nmaturing of machine learning, supported in part by cloud computing resources\nand wide-spread, web-based data gathering.\n\nMachine learning has been propelled\ndramatically forward by “deep learning,” a form of adaptive artificial neural\nnetworks trained using a method called backpropagation.16 This leap in the\nperformance of information processing algorithms has been accompanied by\nsignificant progress in hardware technology for basic operations such as sensing,\nperception, and object recognition.\n\nNew platforms and markets for data-driven\nproducts, and the economic incentives to find new products and markets, have also\ncontributed to the advent of AI-driven technology .\n\nAll these trends drive the “hot” areas of research described below.\n\nThis compilation\nis meant simply to reflect the areas that, by one metric or another, currently receive\ngreater attention than others.\n\nThey are not necessarily more important or valuable\nthan other ones.\n\nIndeed, some of the currently “hot” areas were less popular in past\nyears, and it is likely that other areas will similarly re-emerge in the future.\n\nLarge-scale machine learning\nMany of the basic problems in machine learning (such as supervised and\nunsupervised learning) are well-understood.\n\nA major focus of current efforts is to\nscale existing algorithms to work with extremely large data sets.\n\nFor example, whereas\ntraditional methods could afford to make several passes over the data set, modern\nones are designed to make only a single pass; in some cases, only sublinear methods\n(those that only look at a fraction of the data) can be admitted.\n\nDeep learning\nThe ability to successfully train convolutional neural networks has most benefited the\nfield of computer vision, with applications such as object recognition,

history of AI, including a description of some of the traditionally\ncore areas of research, which have shifted over the past six decades.\n\nBackpropagation is an abbreviation for “backward propagation of errors,” a common method\nof training artificial neural networks used in conjunction with an optimization method such as\ngradient descent.\n\nThe method calculates the gradient of a loss function with respect to all the\nweights in the network.Human intelligence has\nno match in the biological\nand artificial worlds for\nsheer versatility, with\nthe abilities “to reason,\nachieve goals, understand\nand generate language...\n\ncreate art and music, and\neven write histories.”\n15labeling, activity recognition, and several variants thereof.\n\nDeep learning is also making\nsignificant inroads into other areas of perception, such as audio, speech, and natural\nlanguage processing.\n\nReinforcement learning\nWhereas traditional machine learning has mostly focused on pattern mining,\nreinforcement learning shifts the focus to decision making, and is a technology that\nwill help AI to advance more deeply into the realm of learning about and executing\nactions in the real world.\n\nIt has existed for several decades as a framework for\nexperience-driven sequential decision-making, but the methods have not found great\nsuccess in practice, mainly owing to issues of representation and scaling.\n\nHowever,\nthe advent of deep learning has provided reinforcement learning with a “shot in the\narm.” The recent success of AlphaGo, a computer program developed by Google\nDeepmind that beat the human Go champion in a five-game match, was due in large\npart to reinforcement learning.\n\nAlphaGo was trained by initializing an automated\nagent with a human expert database, but was subsequently refined by playing a large\nnumber of games against itself and applying reinforcement learning.\n\nRobotics\nRobotic navigation, at least in static environments, is largely solved.\n\nCurrent efforts\nconsider how to train a robot to interact with the world around it in generalizable\nand predictable ways.\n\nA natural requirement that arises in interactive environments\nis manipulation , another topic of current interest.\n\nThe deep learning revolution is\nonly beginning to influence robotics, in large part because it is far more difficult to\nacquire the large labeled data sets that have driven other learning-based areas of AI.\n\nReinforcement learning (see above), which obviates the requirement of labeled data,\nmay help bridge this gap but requires systems to be able to safely explore a policy\nspace without committing errors that harm the system itself or others.\n\nAdvances in\nreliable machine perception, including computer vision, force, and tactile perception,\nmuch of which will be driven by machine learning, will continue to be key enablers to\nadvancing the capabilities of robotics.\n\nComputer vision\nComputer vision is currently the most prominent form of machine perception.\n\nIt has\nbeen the sub-area of AI most transformed by the rise of deep learning.\n\nUntil just a\nfew years ago, support vector machines were the method of choice for most visual\nclassification tasks.\n\nBut the confluence of large-scale computing, especially on GPUs,\nthe availability of large datasets, especially via the internet, and refinements of neural\nnetwork algorithms has led to dramatic improvements in performance on benchmark\ntasks (e.g., classification on ImageNet17).\n\nFor the first time, computers are able to\nperform some (narrowly defined) visual classification tasks better than people.\n\nMuch\ncurrent research is focused on automatic image and video captioning.\n\nNatural Language Processing\nOften coupled with automatic speech recognition, Natural Language Processing is\nanother very active area of machine perception.\n\nIt is quickly becoming a commodity\nfor mainstream languages with large data sets.\n\nGoogle announced that 20% of\ncurrent mobile queries are done by voice,18 and recent demonstrations have proven\nthe possibility of real-time translation.\n\nResearch is now shifting towards developing\nrefined and capable systems that are able to interact with people through dialog, not\njust react to stylized requests.\n\nImageNet,

intelligent to\nbuilding intelligent\nsystems that are\nhuman-aware and\ntrustworthy.\n\n16Collaborative systems\nResearch on collaborative systems investigates models and algorithms to help\ndevelop autonomous systems that can work collaboratively with other systems and\nwith humans.\n\nThis research relies on developing formal models of collaboration,\nand studies the capabilities needed for systems to become effective partners.\n\nThere\nis growing interest in applications that can utilize the complementary strengths of\nhumans and machines—for humans to help AI systems to overcome their

that can utilize the complementary strengths of\nhumans and machines—for humans to help AI systems to overcome their limitations,\nand for agents to augment human abilities and activities.\n\nCrowdsourcing and human computation\nSince human abilities are superior to automated methods for accomplishing many\ntasks, research on crowdsourcing and human computation investigates methods to\naugment computer systems by utilizing human intelligence to solve problems that\ncomputers alone cannot solve well.\n\nIntroduced only about fifteen years ago, this\nresearch now has an established presence in AI.\n\nThe best-known example of\ncrowdsourcing is Wikipedia, a knowledge repository that is maintained and updated\nby netizens and that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such\nas encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth.\n\nCrowdsourcing focuses on\ndevising innovative ways to harness human intelligence.\n\nCitizen science platforms\nenergize volunteers to solve scientific problems, while paid crowdsourcing platforms\nsuch as Amazon Mechanical Turk provide automated access to human intelligence on\ndemand.\n\nWork in this area has facilitated advances in other subfields of AI, including\ncomputer vision and NLP , by enabling large amounts of labeled training data and/or\nhuman interaction data to be collected in a short amount of time.\n\nCurrent research\nefforts explore ideal divisions of tasks between humans and machines based on their\ndiffering capabilities and costs.\n\nAlgorithmic game theory and computational social choice\nNew attention is being drawn to the economic and social computing dimensions of\nAI, including incentive structures.\n\nDistributed AI and multi-agent systems have been\nstudied since the early 1980s, gained prominence starting in the late 1990s, and were\naccelerated by the internet.\n\nA natural requirement is that systems handle potentially\nmisaligned incentives, including self-interested human participants or firms, as well\nas automated AI-based agents representing them.\n\nTopics receiving attention include\ncomputational mechanism design (an economic theory of incentive design, seeking\nincentive-compatible systems where inputs are truthfully reported), computational\nsocial choice (a theory for how to aggregate rank orders on alternatives), incentive\naligned information elicitation (prediction markets, scoring rules, peer prediction) and\nalgorithmic game theory (the equilibria of markets, network games, and parlor games\nsuch as Poker—a game where significant advances have been made in recent years\nthrough abstraction techniques and no-regret learning).\n\nInternet of Things (IoT)\nA growing body of research is devoted to the idea that a wide array of devices can\nbe interconnected to collect and share their sensory information.\n\nSuch devices can\ninclude appliances, vehicles, buildings, cameras, and other things.\n\nWhile it’s a matter\nof technology and wireless networking to connect the devices, AI can process and\nuse the resulting huge amounts of data for intelligent and useful purposes.\n\nCurrently ,\nthese devices use a bewildering array of incompatible communication protocols.\n\nAI\ncould help tame this Tower of Babel.\n\nNeuromorphic Computing\nTraditional computers implement the von Neumann model of computing, which\nseparates the modules for input/output, instruction-processing, and memory .\n\nWith\nthe success of deep neural networks on a wide array of tasks, manufacturers are Natural Language\nProcessing is a very\nactive area of machine\nperception.\n\nResearch\nis now shifting towards\ndeveloping systems that\nare able to interact with\npeople through dialog,\nnot just react to stylized\nrequests.\n\n17actively pursuing alternative models of computing—especially those that are inspired\nby what is known about biological neural networks—with the aim of improving the\nhardware efficiency and robustness of computing systems.\n\nAt the moment, such\n“neuromorphic” computers have not yet clearly demonstrated big wins, and are just\nbeginning to become commercially viable.\n\nBut it is possible that they will become\ncommonplace (even if only as additions to their von Neumann cousins) in the\nnear future.\n\nDeep neural networks have already created a splash in the application\nlandscape.\n\nA larger wave may hit when these networks can be trained and executed\non dedicated neuromorphic hardware, as opposed to simulated on standard von\nNeumann architectures, as they are today .\n\nOverall trends and the future of AI research\nThe resounding success of the data-driven paradigm has displaced the traditional\nparadigms of AI.\n\nProcedures such as theorem proving and logic-based knowledge\nrepresentation and reasoning are receiving reduced attention, in part because of the\nongoing challenge of connecting with real-world groundings.\n\nPlanning, which was a\nmainstay of AI research in the seventies and eighties, has also received less attention\nof late due in part to its strong reliance on modeling assumptions that are hard\nto satisfy in realistic applications.\n\nModel-based approaches—such as physics-based\napproaches to vision and traditional control and mapping in robotics—have by and\nlarge given way to data-driven approaches that close the loop with sensing the results\nof actions in the task at hand.\n\nBayesian reasoning and graphical models, which were\nvery popular even quite recently , also appear to be going out of favor, having been\ndrowned by the deluge of data and the remarkable success of deep learning.\n\nOver the next fifteen years, the Study Panel expects an increasing focus on\ndeveloping systems that are human-aware, meaning that they specifically model,\nand are specifically designed for, the characteristics of the people with whom they\nare meant to interact.\n\nThere is a lot of interest in trying to find new, creative ways\nto develop interactive and scalable ways to teach robots.\n\nAlso, IoT-type systems—\ndevices and the cloud—are becoming increasingly popular, as is thinking about\nsocial and economic dimensions of AI.\n\nIn the coming years, new perception/object\nrecognition capabilities and robotic platforms that are human-safe will grow, as will\ndata-driven products and their markets.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 4, "char_count": 6226, "token_estimate": 1202, "word_count": 909, "has_header": true,

predicted that mainstream companies\nwould be developing and deploying autonomous cars by 2015.\n\nDuring the first\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) “grand challenge” on\nautonomous driving in 2004, research teams failed to complete the challenge in a\nlimited desert setting.\n\nBut in eight short years, from 2004-2012, speedy and surprising progress occurred\nin both academia and industry .\n\nAdvances in sensing technology and machine learning\nfor perception tasks has sped progress and, as a result, Google’s autonomous vehicles\nand Tesla’s semi-autonomous cars are driving on city streets today .\n\nGoogle’s selfdriving cars, which have logged more than 1,500,000 miles (300,000 miles without an\naccident),33 are completely autonomous—no human input needed.\n\nTesla has widely\nreleased self-driving capability to existing cars with a software update.34 Their cars are\nsemi-autonomous, with human drivers expected to stay engaged and take over if they\ndetect a potential problem.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether this semi-autonomous approach\nis sustainable, since as people become more confident in the cars’ capabilities, they\nare likely to pay less attention to the road, and become less reliable when they are\nmost needed.\n\nThe first traffic fatality involving an autonomous car, which occurred in\nJune of 2016, brought this question into sharper focus.35\nIn the near future, sensing algorithms will achieve super-human performance for\ncapabilities required for driving.\n\nAutomated perception, including vision, is already\nnear or at human-level performance for well-defined tasks such as recognition and\ntracking.\n\nAdvances in perception will be followed by algorithmic improvements\nin higher level reasoning capabilities such as planning.\n\nA recent report predicts\nself-driving cars to be widely adopted by 2020.36 And the adoption of self-driving\ncapabilities won’t be limited to personal transportation.\n\nWe will see self-driving and\nremotely controlled delivery vehicles, flying vehicles, and trucks.\n\nPeer-to-peer\ntransportation services such as ridesharing are also likely to utilize self-driving vehicles.\n\nBeyond self-driving cars, advances in robotics will facilitate the creation and adoption\nof other types of autonomous vehicles, including robots and drones.\n\nIt is not yet clear how much better self-driving cars need to become to encourage\nbroad acceptance.\n\nThe collaboration required in semi-self-driving cars and its\nimplications for the cognitive load of human drivers is not well understood.\n\nBut\nif future self-driving cars are adopted with the predicted speed, and they exceed\nhuman-level performance in driving, other significant societal changes will follow.\n\nSelf-driving cars will eliminate one of the biggest causes of accidental death and\ninjury in United States, and lengthen people’s life expectancy .\n\nOn average, a “Navlab,” Wikipedia ,

with only bytes of\nRAM, ran a behavior based controller.\n\nThe most intelligent thing it did was to avoid\nfalling down stairs.\n\nSince then, sixteen million Roombas have been deployed all

.\n\nPerceptual algorithms Over the next fifteen years,\ncoincident advances\nin mechanical and AI\ntechnologies promise to\nincrease the safe and\nreliable use and utility of\nhome robots in a typical\nNorth American city.\n\n25for functions such as image labeling, and 3D object recognition, while common at AI\nconferences, are still only a few years into development as products.\n\nHome robots Despite the slow growth to date of robots in the home, there are signs that this will\nchange in the next fifteen years.\n\nCorporations such as Amazon Robotics and Uber\nare developing large economies of scale using various aggregation technologies.\n\nAlso:\nSystem in Module (SiM), with a lot of System on Chip (SoC) subsystems, are\nnow being pushed out the door by phone-chip makers (Qualcomm’s SnapDragon,\nSamsung’s Artik, etc.).\n\nThese are better than supercomputers of less than ten years\nago with eight or more sixty-four-bit cores, and specialized silicon for cryptography ,\ncamera drivers, additional DSPs, and hard silicon for certain perceptual algorithms.\n\nThis means that low cost devices will be able to support much more onboard AI than\nwe have been able to consider over the last fifteen years.\n\nCloud (“someone else’s computer”) is going to enable more rapid release of new\nsoftware on home robots, and more sharing of data sets gathered in many different\nhomes, which will in turn feed cloud-based machine learning, and then power\nimprovements to already deployed robots.\n\nThe great advances in speech understanding and image labeling enabled by deep\nlearning will enhance robots’ interactions with people in their homes.\n\nLow cost 3D sensors, driven by gaming platforms, have fueled work on 3D\nperception algorithms by thousands of researchers worldwide, which will speed the\ndevelopment and adoption of home and service robots.\n\nIn the past three years, low cost and safe robot arms have been introduced to\nhundreds of research labs around the world, sparking a new class of research on\nmanipulation that will eventually be applicable in the home, perhaps around 2025.\n\nMore than half a dozen startups around the world are developing AI-based robots for\nthe home, for now concentrating mainly on social interaction.\n\nNew ethics and privacy\nissues may surface as a result.\n\nHEALTHCARE\nFor AI technologies, healthcare has long been viewed as a promising domain.\n\nAI-based applications could improve health outcomes and quality of life for\nmillions of people in the coming years—but only if they gain the trust of doctors,\nnurses, and patients, and if policy , regulatory , and commercial obstacles are removed.\n\nPrime applications include clinical decision support, patient monitoring and\ncoaching, automated devices to assist in surgery or patient care, and management\nof healthcare systems.\n\nRecent successes, such as mining social media to infer\npossible health risks, machine learning to predict patients at risk, and robotics\nto support surgery , have expanded a sense of possibility for AI in healthcare.\n\nImprovements in methods for interacting with medical professionals and patients\nwill be a critical challenge.\n\nAs in other domains, data is a key enabler.\n\nThere has been an immense forward\nleap in collecting useful data from personal monitoring devices and mobile apps, from\nelectronic health records (EHR) in clinical settings and, to a lesser extent, from robots\ndesigned to assist with medical procedures and hospital operations.\n\nBut using this\ndata to enable more finely-grained diagnostics and treatments for both individual\npatients and patient populations has proved difficult.\n\nResearch and deployment have\nbeen slowed by outdated regulations and incentive structures.\n\nPoor human-computer\ninteraction methods and the inherent difficulties and risks of implementing\ntechnologies in such a large and complex system have slowed realization of AI’s Special purpose robots\nwill deliver packages,\nclean offices, and enhance\nsecurity, but technical\nconstraints and high\ncosts will continue to limit\ncommercial opportunities\nfor the foreseeable future.\n\n26promise in healthcare.61 The reduction or removal of these obstacles, combined with\ninnovations still on the horizon, have the potential to significantly improve health\noutcomes and quality of life for millions of people in the coming years.\n\nThe clinical setting\nFor decades, the vision of an AI-powered clinician’s assistant has been a near cliché.\n\nAlthough there have been successful pilots of AI-related technology in healthcare,62\nthe current healthcare delivery system unfortunately remains structurally ill-suited to\nabsorb and deploy rapid advances.\n\nIncentives provided by the Affordable Care Act\nhave accelerated the penetration of electronic health records (EHRs) into clinical\npractice, but implementation has been poor, eroding clinicians’ confidence in their\nusefulness.\n\nA small group of companies control the EHR market, and user interfaces\nare widely considered substandard, including annoying pop-ups that physicians\nroutinely dismiss.\n\nThe promise of new analytics using data from EHRs, including AI,\nremains largely unrealized due to these and other regulatory and structural barriers.\n\nLooking ahead to the next fifteen years, AI advances, if coupled with sufficient data\nand well-targeted systems, promise to change the cognitive tasks assigned to human\nclinicians.\n\nPhysicians now routinely solicit verbal descriptions of symptoms from\npresenting patients and, in their heads, correlate patterns against the clinical\npresentation of known diseases.\n\nWith automated assistance, the physician could\ninstead supervise this process, applying her or his experience and intuition to guide the\ninput process and to evaluate the output of the machine intelligence.", "metadata":

experience of the physician will remain critical.\n\nA significant challenge is to\noptimally integrate the human dimensions of care with automated reasoning processes.\n\nTo achieve future advances, clinicians must be involved and engaged at the outset to\nensure that systems are well-engineered and trusted.\n\nAlready , a new generation of more\ntech savvy physicians routinely utilize specialized apps on mobile devices.\n\nAt the same\ntime, workloads on primary care clinicians have increased to the point that they are\ngrateful for help from any quarter.\n\nThus, the opportunity to exploit new learning methods,\nto create structured patterns of inference by mining the scientific literature automatically ,\nand to create true cognitive assistants by supporting free-form dialogue, has never\nbeen greater.\n\nProvided these advances are not stymied by regulatory , legal, and social\nbarriers, immense improvements to the value of healthcare are within our

treatment.\n\nAutomated discovery of genotype-phenotype connections will also become possible\nas full, once-in-a-lifetime genome sequencing becomes routine for each patient.\n\nA related (and perhaps earlier) capability will be to find “patients like mine” as a way\nto inform treatment decisions based on analysis of a similar cohort.\n\nTraditional and\nnon-traditional healthcare data, augmented by social platforms, may lead to the emergence\nof self-defined subpopulations, each managed by a surrounding ecosystem of healthcare\nproviders augmented with automated recommendation and monitoring

becoming more commercially viable as vendors discover ways to engage\nlarge populations (e.g.\n\nShareCare)63 and then to create population-scale data that can\nbe mined to produce individualized analytics and recommendations.\n\nUnfortunately , the FDA has been slow to approve innovative diagnostic software,\nand there are many remaining barriers to rapid innovation.\n\nHIPAA (Health Insurance\nPortability and Accountability Act) requirements for protecting patient privacy create\nlegal barriers to the flow of patient data to applications that could utilize AI technologies.\n\nUnanticipated negative effects of approved drugs could show up routinely , sooner, and\nmore rigorously than they do today , but mobile apps that analyze drug interactions\nmay be blocked from pulling the necessary information from patient records.\n\nMore\ngenerally , AI research and innovation in healthcare are hampered by the lack of\nwidely accepted methods and standards for privacy protection.\n\nThe FDA has been\nslow to approve innovative software, in part due to an unclear understanding of the\ncost/benefit tradeoffs of these systems.\n\nIf regulators (principally the FDA) recognize\nthat effective post-marketing reporting is a dependable hedge against some safety risks,\nfaster initial approval of new treatments and interventions may become possible.\n\nAutomated image interpretation has also been a promising subject of study for\ndecades.\n\nProgress on interpreting large archives of weakly-labeled images, such as\nlarge photo archives scraped from the web, has been explosive.\n\nAt first blush, it is\nsurprising that there has not been a similar revolution in interpretation of medical\nimages.\n\nMost medical imaging modalities (CT , MR, ultrasound) are inherently digital,\nthe images are all archived, and there are large, established companies with internal\nR&D (e.g.\n\nSiemens, Philips, GE) devoted to imaging.\n\nBut several barriers have limited progress to date.\n\nMost hospital image archives\nhave only gone digital over the past decade.\n\nMore importantly , the problem in\nmedicine is not to recognize what is in the image (is this a liver or a kidney?), but\nrather to make a fine-grained judgement about it (does the slightly darker smudge\nin the liver suggest a potentially cancerous tumor?).\n\nStrict regulations govern these\nhigh-stakes judgements.\n\nEven with state-of-the-art technologies, a radiologist will still\nlikely have to look at the images, so the value proposition is not yet compelling.\n\nAlso,\nhealthcare regulations preclude easy federation of data across institutions.\n\nThus, only\nvery large organizations of integrated care, such as Kaiser Permanente, are able to\nattack these problems.\n\nStill, automated/augmented image interpretation has started to gain momentum.\n\nThe next fifteen years will probably not bring fully automated radiology , but initial forays\ninto image “triage” or second level checking will likely improve the speed and costeffectiveness of medical imaging.\n\nWhen coupled with electronic patient record systems,\nlarge-scale machine learning techniques could be applied to medical image data.\n\nFor\nexample, multiple major healthcare systems have archives of millions of patient scans,\neach of which has an associated

orthopedic\nsurgeries, such as hip and knee replacements.\n\nThe technology worked, but the\ncompany struggled commercially , and was ultimately shut down and acquired for\nits technology .66 More recently , though, the research and practical use of surgical\nrobotics has exploded.\n\nIn Intuitive Surgical67 introduced the da Vinci system, a novel technology\ninitially marketed to support minimally invasive heart bypass surgery , and then gained\nsubstantial market traction for treatment of prostate cancer and merged with its\nonly major competition, Computer Motion, in 2003.\n\nThe da Vinci, now in its fourth\ngeneration, provides 3D visualization (as opposed to 2D monocular laparoscopy) and\nwristed instruments in an ergonomic platform.\n\nIt is considered the standard of care\nin multiple laparoscopic procedures, and used in nearly three quarters of a million\nprocedures a year,68 providing not only a physical platform, but also a new data\nplatform for studying the process of surgery .\n\nThe da Vinci anticipates a day when much greater insight into how medical\nprofessionals carry out the process of providing interventional medical care will\nbe possible.\n\nThe presence of the da Vinci in day-to-day operation has also opened\nthe doors to new types of innovation—from new instrumentation to image fusion\nto novel biomarkers—creating its own innovation ecosystem.\n\nThe success of the\nplatform has inspired potential competitors in robotic surgery , most notably the\nAlphabet spin-off Verb, in collaboration with J&J/Ethicon.69 There are likely to be\nmany more, each exploring a unique niche or space and building out an ecosystem of\nsensing, data analytics, augmentation, and automation.\n\nIntelligent automation in hospital operations has been less successful.\n\nThe story\nis not unlike surgical robotics.\n\nTwenty years ago, one company , HelpMate, created\na robot for hospital deliveries,70 such as meals and medical records, but ultimately\nwent bankrupt.\n\nMore recently , Aethon71 introduced TUG Robots for basic deliveries,\nbut few hospitals have invested in this technology to date.\n\nHowever, robotics in\nother service industries such as hotels and warehouses, including Amazon Robotics\n(formerly Kiva), are demonstrating that these technologies are practical and cost\neffective in at least some large-scale settings, and may ultimately spur additional\ninnovation in health care.\n\nLooking ahead, many tasks that appear in healthcare will be amenable to\naugmentation, but will not be fully automated.\n\nFor example, robots may be able to\ndeliver goods to the right room in a hospital, but then require a person to pick them\nup and place them in their final location.\n\nWalking a patient down the corridor

future systems will involve intimate interaction between people and\nmachines and require technologies that facilitate collaboration between them.\n\nThe growth of automation will enable new insights into healthcare processes.\n\nHistorically , robotics has not been a strongly data-driven or data-oriented science.\n\nThis is changing as (semi)automation infiltrates healthcare.\n\nAs the new surgical,\ndelivery , and patient care platforms come online, the beginnings of quantification\nand predictive analytics are being built on top of data coming from these platforms.73\nThis data will be used to assess quality of performance, identify deficiencies, errors,\nor potential optimizations, and will be used as feedback to improve performance.\n\nIn\nshort, these platforms will facilitate

relied on traditional healthcare\ndata—mainly the electronic medical records discussed above.\n\nIn the clinical setting,\nthere are hopeful trends towards bringing new data to bear.\n\nFor example, TeleLanguage enables a human clinician to conduct language therapy sessions with\nmultiple patients simultaneously with the aid of an AI agent trained by the clinician.\n\nAnd Lifegraph, which extracts behavioral patterns and creates alerts from data\npassively collected from a patient’s smartphone, has been adopted by psychiatrists in\nIsrael to detect early signs of distressful behavior in patients.\n\nLooking ahead, driven by the mobile computing revolution, the astonishing growth\nof “biometrics in the wild”—and the explosion of platforms and applications that use\nthem—is a hopeful and unanticipated trend.\n\nThousands of mobile apps now offer\ninformation, introduce behavior modification, or identify groups of “people like me.”\nThis, combined with the emerging trend of more specialized motion tracking devices,\nsuch as Fitbit, and the emerging (inter)connectedness between the home environment\nand health-monitoring devices, has created a vibrant new sector of innovation.\n\nBy combining social and healthcare data, some healthcare apps can perform data\nmining, learning, and prediction from captured data, though their predictions are\nrelatively rudimentary .\n\nThe convergence of data and functionality across applications\nwill likely spur new and even obvious products, such as an exercise app that not only\nproposes a schedule for exercise but also suggests the best time to do it, and provides\ncoaching to stick to that schedule.\n\nAzad Shademan, Ryan S.\n\nDecker, Justin D.\n\nOpfermann, Simon Leonard, Axel Krieger, and\nPeter CW Kim,

that home health\naides will grow 38% over the next ten years.\n\nDespite the broad opportunities in this\ndomain—basic social support, interaction and communication devices, home health\nmonitoring, a variety of simple in-home physical aids such as walkers, and light meal\npreparation—little has happened over the past fifteen years.\n\nBut the coming generational\nshift will accompany a change in technology acceptance among the elderly .\n\nCurrently ,\nsomeone who is seventy was born in and may have first experienced some form\nof personalized IT in middle age or later, while a fifty-year-old today is far more\ntechnology-friendly and savvy .\n\nAs a result, there will be a growing interest and market\nfor already available and maturing technologies to support physical, emotional, social,\nand mental health.\n\nHere are a few likely examples by category:\nLife quality and independence\n- Automated transportation will support continued independence and expanded\nsocial horizons.\n\n- Sharing of information will help families remain engaged with one another at a\ndistance, and predictive analytics may be used to “nudge” family groups toward\npositive behaviors, such as reminders to “call home.”\n- Smart devices in the home will help with daily living activities when needed,\nsuch as cooking and, if robot manipulation capabilities improve sufficiently ,\ndressing and toileting.\n\nHealth and wellness\n- Mobile applications that monitor movement and activities, coupled with social\nplatforms, will be able to make recommendations to maintain mental and\nphysical health.\n\n- In-home health monitoring and health information access will be able to detect\nchanges in mood or behavior and alert caregivers.\n\n- Personalized health management will help mitigate the complexities associated\nwith multiple co-morbid conditions and/or treatment interactions.\n\nTreatments and devices\n- Better hearing aids and visual assistive devices will mitigate the effects of\nhearing and vision loss, improving safety and social connection.\n\n- Personalized rehabilitation and in-home therapy will reduce the need for\nhospital or care facility stays.\n\n- Physical assistive devices (intelligent walkers, wheel chairs, and exoskeletons) will\nextend the range of activities of an infirm individual.\n\nThe Study Panel expects an explosion of low-cost sensing technologies that can\nprovide substantial capabilities to the elderly in their homes.\n\nIn principle, social\nagents with a physical presence and simple physical capabilities (e.g.\n\na mobile robot\nwith basic communication capabilities) could provide a platform for new innovations.\n\nHowever, doing so will require integration across multiple areas of AI—Natural\nLanguage Processing, reasoning, learning, perception, and robotics—to create\na system that is useful and usable by the elderly .\n\nThese innovations will also introduce questions regarding privacy within various\ncircles, including friends, family , and care-givers, and create new challenges to\naccommodate an evermore active and engaged population far past retirement.\n\nJennifer M.\n\nOrtman,

variation between K-12\nand university settings.\n\nThough quality education will always require active engagement\nby human teachers, AI promises to enhance education at all levels, especially by\nproviding personalization at scale.\n\nSimilar to healthcare, resolving how to best\nintegrate human interaction and face-to-face learning with promising AI technologies\nremains a key challenge.\n\nRobots have long been popular educational devices, starting with the early\nLego Mindstorms kits developed with the MIT Media Lab in the 1980s.\n\nIntelligent\nTutoring Systems (ITS) for science, math, language, and other disciplines match\nstudents with interactive machine tutors.\n\nNatural Language Processing, especially when\ncombined with machine learning and crowdsourcing, has boosted online learning\nand enabled teachers to multiply the size of their classrooms while simultaneously\naddressing individual students’ learning needs and styles.\n\nThe data sets from large\nonline learning systems have fueled rapid growth in learning analytics.\n\nStill, schools and universities have been slow in adopting AI technologies primarily\ndue to lack of funds and lack of solid evidence that they help students achieve\nlearning objectives.\n\nOver the next fifteen years in a typical North American city , the\nuse of intelligent tutors and other AI technologies to assist teachers in the classroom\nand in the home is likely to expand significantly , as will learning based on virtual\nreality applications.\n\nBut computer-based learning systems are not likely to fully\nreplace human teaching in schools.\n\nTeaching robots\nToday , more sophisticated and versatile kits for use in K-12 schools are available\nfrom a number of companies that create robots with new sensing technologies\nprogrammable in a variety of languages.\n\nOzobot is a robot that teaches children\nto code and reason deductively while configuring it to dance or play based on\ncolor-coded patterns.75 Cubelets help teach children logical thinking through\nassembling robot blocks to think, act, or sense, depending upon the function of the\ndifferent blocks.76 Wonder Workshop’s Dash and Dot span a range of programming\ncapabilities.\n\nChildren eight years old and older can create simple actions using a\nvisual programming language, Blockly , or build iOS and Android applications using\nC or Java.77 PLEO rb is a robot pet that helps children learn biology by teaching\nthe robot to react to different aspects of the environment.78 However, while fun and\nengaging for some, in order for such kits to become widespread, there will need to be\ncompelling evidence that they improve students’ academic performance.\n\nIntelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) and online learning\nITS have been developed from research laboratory projects such as Why-2 Atlas,\nwhich supported human-machine dialogue to solve physics problems early in the\nera.79 The rapid migration of ITS from

to\nco-grade essays in standardized testing.84 Many of the MOOCs which have become\nso popular, including those created by EdX, Coursera, and Udacity , are making use\nof NLP , machine learning, and crowdsourcing techniques for grading short-answer\nand essay questions as well as programming assignments.85 Online education systems\nthat support graduate-level professional education and lifelong learning are also\nexpanding rapidly .\n\nThese systems have great promise because the need for face-to-face interaction is less important for working professionals and career changers.\n\nWhile not\nthe leaders in AI-supported systems and applications, they will become early adopters\nas the technologies are tested and validated.\n\nIt can be argued that AI is the secret sauce that has enabled instructors, particularly\nin higher education, to multiply the size of their classrooms by a few orders of\nmagnitude—class sizes of a few tens of thousands are not uncommon.\n\nIn order

for use in online education.\n\nAlthough the long term impact of these systems will have on the educational system\nremains unclear, the AI community has learned a great deal in a very short time.\n\nLearning analytics\nData sets being collected from massive scale online learning systems, ranging from\nMOOCs to Khan Academy , as well as smaller scale online programs, have fueled\nthe rapid growth of the field of learning analytics.\n\nOnline courses are not only good\nfor widespread delivery , but are natural vehicles for data collection and experimental\ninstrumentation that will contribute to scientific findings and improving the quality\nof learning at scale.\n\nOrganizations such as the Society for Learning Analytics\nResearch (SOLAR), and the rise of conferences including the Learning Analytics and\nKnowledge Conference89 and the Learning at Scale Conference (L@S)90 reflect this\ntrend.\n\nThis community applies deep learning, natural language processing, and other\nAI techniques to analysis of student engagement, behavior, and outcomes.\n\nCurrent projects seek to model common student misconceptions, predict\nwhich students are at risk of failure, and provide real-time student feedback that is\ntightly integrated with learning outcomes.\n\nRecent work has also been devoted to\nunderstanding the cognitive processes involved in comprehension, writing, knowledge\nacquisition, and memory , and to applying that understanding to educational practice\nby developing and testing educational technologies.\n\nChallenges and opportunities\nOne might have expected more and more sophisticated use of AI technologies in\nschools, colleges, and universities by now.\n\nMuch of its absence can be explained\nby the lack of financial resources of these institutions as well as the lack of data\nestablishing the technologies’ effectiveness.\n\nThese problems are being addressed,\nalbeit slowly , by private foundations and by numerous programs to train primarily\nsecondary school teachers in summer programs.\n\nAs in other areas of AI, excessive\nhype and promises about the capabilities of MOOCs have meant that expectations\nfrequently exceed the reality .\n\nThe experiences of certain institutions, such as San Jose\nState University’s experiment with Udacity ,91 have led to more sober assessment of\nthe potential of the new educational

current absence of\nsophisticated use of AI\ntechnologies in schools,\ncolleges, and universities\nmay be explained by\nthe lack of financial\nresources as well as the\nlack of data establishing\nthe technologies’\neffectiveness.\n\n34In the next fifteen years, it is likely that human teachers will be assisted by AI\ntechnologies with better human interaction, both in the classroom and in the home.\n\nThe Study Panel expects that more general and more sophisticated virtual reality\nscenarios in which students can immerse themselves in subjects from all disciplines\nwill be developed.\n\nSome steps in this direction are being taken now by increasing\ncollaborations between AI researchers and researchers in the humanities and social\nsciences, exemplified by Stanford’s Galileo Correspondence Project92 and Columbia’s\nMaking and Knowing Project.93 These interdisciplinary efforts create interactive\nexperiences with historical documents and the use of Virtual Reality (VR) to explore\ninteractive archeological sites.94 VR techniques are already being used in the natural\nsciences such as biology , anatomy , geology and astronomy to allow students to interact\nwith environments and objects that are difficult to engage with in the real world.\n\nThe\nrecreation of past worlds and fictional worlds will become just as popular for studies\nof arts and other sciences.\n\nAI techniques will increasingly blur the line between formal, classroom education\nand self-paced, individual learning.\n\nAdaptive learning systems, for example, are going\nto become a core part of the teaching process in higher education because of the\npressures to contain cost while serving a larger number of students and moving students\nthrough school more quickly .\n\nWhile formal education will not disappear, the Study\nPanel believes that MOOCs and other forms of online education will become part of\nlearning at all levels, from K-12 through university , in a blended classroom experience.\n\nThis development will facilitate more customizable approaches to learning, in which\nstudents can learn at their own pace using educational techniques that work best for\nthem.\n\nOnline education systems will learn as the students learn, supporting rapid\nadvances in our understanding of the learning process.\n\nLearning analytics, in turn, will\naccelerate the development of tools for personalized education.\n\nThe current transition from hard copy books to digital and audio media and texts\nis likely to become prevalent in education as well.\n\nDigital reading devices will also\nbecome much ‘smarter’, providing students with easy access to additional information\nabout subject matter as they study .\n\nMachine Translation (MT) technology will\nalso make it easier to translate educational material into different languages with a\nfair degree of accuracy , just as it currently translates technical manuals.\n\nTextbook\ntranslation services that currently depend only upon human translators will\nincreasingly incorporate automatic methods to improve the speed and affordability of\ntheir services for school systems.\n\nOnline learning systems will also expand the opportunity for adults and working\nprofessionals to enhance their knowledge and skills (or to retool and learn a new field)\nin a world where these fields are evolving rapidly .\n\nThis will include the expansion\nof fully online professional degrees as well as professional certifications based on\nonline coursework.\n\nBroader societal consequences\nIn countries where education is difficult for the broad population to obtain, online\nresources may have a positive effect if the population has the tools to access them.\n\nThe development of online educational

also\noccurs more and more online, what effect will the lack of regular, face-to-face contact\nwith peers have on students’ social development?\n\nCertain technologies have even\nbeen shown to create neurological side effects.95 On the other hand, autistic children\nhave benefited from interactions with AI systems already .96\nLOW-RESOURCE COMMUNITIES\nMany opportunities exist for AI to improve conditions for people in low-resource\ncommunities in a typical North American city—and, indeed, in some cases it\nalready has.\n\nUnderstanding these direct AI contributions may also inform potential\ncontributions in the poorest parts of the developing world.\n\nThere has not been a\nsignificant focus on these populations in AI gatherings, and, traditionally , AI funders\nhave underinvested in research lacking commercial application.\n\nWith targeted incentives\nand funding priorities, AI technologies could help address the needs of low-resource\ncommunities.\n\nBudding efforts are promising.\n\nCounteracting fears that AI may contribute\nto joblessness and other societal problems, AI may provide mitigations and solutions,\nparticularly if implemented in ways that build trust in them by the affected communities.\n\nMachine learning, data mining approaches\nUnder the banner of “data science for social good,” AI has been used to create\npredictive models to help government agencies more effectively use their limited\nbudgets to address problems such as lead poisoning,97 a major public health concern\nthat has been in the news due to ongoing events in Flint, Michigan.\n\nChildren may\nbe tested for elevated lead levels, but that unfortunately means the problem is only\ndetected after they have already been poisoned.\n\nMany efforts are underway to use\npredictive models to assist government agencies in prioritizing children at\nrisk, including those who may not yet have been exposed.98 Similarly , the Illinois\nDepartment of Human Services (IDHS) uses predictive models to identify pregnant\nwomen at risk for adverse birth outcomes in order to maximize the impact of\nprenatal care.\n\nThe City of Cincinnati uses them to proactively identify and deploy\ninspectors to properties at risk of code violations.\n\nScheduling, planning\nTask assignment scheduling and planning techniques have been applied by many\ndifferent groups to distribute food before it spoils from those who may have excess,\nsuch as restaurants, to food banks, community centers and individuals.99 Scientist have studied, for example, the way reliance on GPS may lead to changes in the\nhippocampus.\n\nKim Tingley , “The Secrets of the Wave Pilots,” The New York Times , March 17, 2016,\npilots.html.\n\nJudith Newman, “To Siri, With Love: How One Boy With

maximization\nSocial networks can be harnessed to create earlier, less-costly interventions involving\nlarge populations.\n\nFor example, AI might be able to assist in spreading healthrelated information.\n\nIn Los Angeles, there are more than 5,000 homeless youth (ages\nthirteen-twenty-four).\n\nIndividual interventions are difficult and expensive, and the\nyouths’ mistrust of authority dictates that key messages are best spread through peer\nleaders.\n\nAI programs might be able to leverage homeless youth social networks to\nstrategically select peer leaders to spread health-related information, such as how to\navoid spread of HIV .\n\nThe dynamic, uncertain nature of these networks does pose\nchallenges for AI research.100 Care must also be taken to prevent AI systems from\nreproducing discriminatory behavior, such as machine learning that identifies people\nthrough illegal racial indicators, or through highly-correlated surrogate factors, such\nas zip codes.\n\nBut if deployed with great care, greater reliance on AI may well result\nin a reduction in discrimination overall, since AI programs are inherently more easily\naudited than humans.\n\nPUBLIC SAFETY AND SECURITY\nCities already have begun to deploy AI technologies for public safety and security .\n\nBy 2030, the typical North American city will rely heavily upon them.\n\nThese include\ncameras for surveillance that can detect anomalies pointing to a possible crime,\ndrones, and predictive policing applications.\n\nAs with most issues, there are benefits\nand risks.\n\nGaining public trust is crucial.\n\nWhile there are legitimate concerns that\npolicing that incorporates AI may become overbearing or pervasive in some contexts,\nthe opposite is also possible.\n\nAI may enable policing to become more targeted and\nused only when needed.\n\nAnd assuming careful deployment, AI may also help remove\nsome of the bias inherent in human decision-making

more\nwidespread surveillance.\n\nSome cities have already added drones for surveillance\npurposes, and police use of drones to maintain security of ports, airports, coastal\nareas, waterways, industrial facilities is likely to increase, raising concerns about\nprivacy , safety , and other issues.\n\nThe New York Police Department’s CompStat was the first tool pointing toward\npredictive policing,104 and many police departments now use it.105 Machine learning\nsignificantly enhances the ability to predict where and when crimes are more likely\nto happen and who may commit them.\n\nAs dramatized in the movie Minority Report ,\npredictive policing tools raise the specter of innocent people being unjustifiably\ntargeted.\n\nBut well-deployed AI prediction tools have the potential to actually remove\nor reduce human bias, rather than reinforcing it, and research and resources should\nbe directed toward ensuring this effect.\n\nAI techniques can be used to develop intelligent simulations for training lawenforcement personnel to collaborate.\n\nWhile international criminal organizations and\nterrorists from different countries are colluding, police forces from different countries\nstill face difficulty in joining forces to fight them.\n\nTraining international groups of law\nenforcement personnel to work as teams is very challenging.\n\nThe European Union,\nthrough the Horizon program, currently supports such attempts in projects such\nas LawTrain.106 The next step will be to move from simulation to actual investigations\nby providing tools that support such collaborations.\n\nTools do exist for scanning Twitter and other feeds to look for certain types\nof events and how they may impact security .\n\nFor example, AI can help in social\nnetwork analysis to prevent those at risk from being radicalized by ISIS or other\nviolent groups.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are increasingly interested in trying to\ndetect plans for disruptive events from social media, and also to monitor activity at\nlarge gatherings of people to analyze security .\n\nThere is significant work on crowd\nsimulations to determine how crowds can be controlled.\n\nAt the same time, legitimate\nconcerns have been raised about the potential for law enforcement agencies to\noverreach and use such tools to violate people’s privacy .\n\nThe US Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Coast Guard, and the\nmany other security agencies that currently rely on AI will likely increase their\nreliance to enable significant efficiency and efficacy improvements.107 AI techniques—\nvision, speech analysis, and gait analysis— can aid interviewers, interrogators, and\nsecurity guards in detecting possible deception and criminal behavior.\n\nFor example,\nthe TSA currently has an ambitious project to redo airport security nationwide.108\nCalled DARMS, the system is designed to improve efficiency and efficacy of airport\nsecurity by relying on personal information to tailor security based on a person’s risk\ncategorization and the flights being taken.\n\nThe future vision for this project is a tunnel\nthat checks people’s security while they walk through it.\n\nOnce again, developers of\nthis technology should be careful to avoid building in bias (e.g.\n\nabout a person’s risk\nlevel category) through use of datasets that reflect prior bias.109 Walter L.\n\nPerry , Brian McInnis, Carter C.\n\nPrice, Susan Smith, and John S.\n\nHollywood, “The\nRole of Crime Forecasting in Law Enforcement Operations,” Rand Corporation Report

WORKPLACE\nWhile AI technologies are likely to have a profound future impact on employment\nand workplace trends in a typical North American city , it is difficult to accurately\nassess current impacts, positive or negative.\n\nIn the past fifteen years, employment\nhas shifted due to a major recession and increasing globalization, particularly with\nChina’s introduction to the world economy , as well as enormous changes in non-AI\ndigital technology .\n\nSince the 1990s, the US has experienced continued growth in\nproductivity and GDP , but median income has stagnated and the employment to\npopulation ratio has fallen.\n\nThere are clear examples of industries in which digital technologies have had\nprofound impacts, good and bad, and other sectors in which automation will likely\nmake major changes in the near future.\n\nMany of these changes have been driven\nstrongly by “routine” digital technologies, including enterprise resource planning,\nnetworking, information processing, and search.\n\nUnderstanding these changes should\nprovide insights into how AI will affect future labor demand, including the shift in\nskill demands.\n\nTo date, digital technologies have been affecting workers more in the\nskilled middle, such as travel agents, rather than the very lowest-skilled or highest\nskilled work.110 On the other hand, the spectrum of tasks that digital systems can\ndo is evolving as AI systems improve, which is likely to gradually increase the scope\nof what is considered routine.\n\nAI is also creeping into high end of the spectrum,\nincluding professional services not historically performed by machines.\n\nTo be successful, AI innovations will need to overcome understandable human\nfears of being marginalized.\n\nAI will likely replace tasks rather than jobs in the near\nterm, and will also create new kinds of jobs.\n\nBut the new jobs that will emerge are\nharder to imagine in advance than the existing jobs that will likely be lost.\n\nChanges\nin employment usually happen gradually , often without a sharp transition, a trend\nlikely to continue as AI slowly moves into the workplace.\n\nA spectrum of effects will\nemerge, ranging from small amounts of replacement or augmentation to complete\nreplacement.\n\nFor example, although most of a lawyer’s job is not yet automated,111\nAI applied to legal information extraction and topic modeling has automated parts of\nfirst-year lawyers’ jobs.112 In the not too distant future, a diverse array of job-holders,\nfrom radiologists to truck drivers to gardeners, may be affected.\n\nAI may also influence the size and location of the workforce.\n\nMany organizations\nand institutions are large because they perform functions that can be scaled only by\nadding human labor, either “horizontally” across geographical areas or “vertically”\nin management hierarchies.\n\nAs AI takes over many functions, scalability no longer\nimplies large organizations.\n\nMany have noted the small number of employees of\nsome high profile internet companies, but not of others.\n\nThere may be a natural scale\nof human enterprise, perhaps where the CEO can know everyone in the company .\n\nThrough the creation of efficiently outsourced labor markets enabled by AI,\nenterprises may tend towards that natural size.\n\nAI will also create jobs, especially in some sectors, by making certain tasks more\nimportant, and create new categories of employment by making new modes of\ninteraction possible.\n\nSophisticated information systems can be used to create new Jeremy

generation.\n\nThis sudden scenario is highly unlikely , but\nAI will gradually invade almost all employment sectors, requiring a shift away from\nhuman labor that computers are able to take over.\n\nThe economic effects of AI on cognitive human jobs will be analogous to\nthe effects of automation and robotics on humans in manufacturing jobs.\n\nMany\nmiddle-aged workers have lost well-paying factory jobs and the socio-economic status\nin family and society that traditionally went with such jobs.\n\nAn even larger fraction\nof the total workforce may , in the long run, lose well-paying “cognitive” jobs.\n\nAs labor\nbecomes a less important factor in production as compared to owning intellectual\ncapital, a majority of citizens may find the value of their labor insufficient to pay for\na socially acceptable standard of living.\n\nThese changes will require a political, rather\nthan a purely economic, response concerning what kind of social safety nets should\nbe in place to protect people from large, structural shifts in the economy .\n\nAbsent\nmitigating policies, the beneficiaries of these shifts may be a small group at the\nupper stratum of the society .113\nIn the short run, education, re-training, and inventing new goods and services may\nmitigate these effects.\n\nLonger term, the current social safety net may need to evolve into\nbetter social services for everyone, such as healthcare and education, or a guaranteed\nbasic income.\n\nIndeed, countries such as Switzerland and Finland have actively considered\nsuch measures.\n\nAI may be thought of as a radically different mechanism of wealth\ncreation in which everyone should be entitled to a portion of the world’s AI-produced\ntreasure.114 It is not too soon for social debate on how the economic fruits of\nAI-technologies should be shared.\n\nAs children in traditional societies support their\naging parents, perhaps our artificially intelligent “children” should support us, the\n“parents” of their intelligence.\n\nFor example, Brynjolfsson and McAfee, Second Machine Age , have two chapters of devoted to\nthis (Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age: Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a\nTime of Brilliant Technologies ,) and Brynjolfsson,\nMcAfee, and Spence describe policy responses for the combination of globalization and digital\ntechnology (Erik Brynjolfsson, Andrew McAfee, and Michael Spence, Foreign Affairs , July/August\n2014, 2014-06-04/new-world-order ).\n\nGDP does not do a good job of measuring the value of many digital goods.\n\nWhen society\ncan’t manage what isn’t measured, bad policy decisions result.\n\nOne alternative is to look at\nconsumer surplus, not just dollar flows.\n\nAs AI is embodied in more goods, this issue becomes more\nsalient.\n\nIt may look like GDP goes down but people have better well-being through access to these\ndigital goods.\n\nSee Erik Brynjolfsson and Adam Saunders, “What the GDP Gets Wrong (Why\nManagers Should Care),” Sloan Management Review , vol.\n\n51, no.: 95–96.As labor becomes a\nless important factor in\nproduction as compared\nto owning intellectual\ncapital, a majority of\ncitizens may find the value\nof their labor insufficient\nto pay for a socially\nacceptable standard of\nliving.\n\n40ENTERTAINMENT\nWith the explosive growth of the internet over the past fifteen years, few can imagine\ntheir daily lives without it.\n\nPowered by AI, the internet has established user-generated\ncontent as a viable source of information and entertainment.\n\nSocial networks such\nas Facebook are now pervasive, and they function as personalized channels of\nsocial interaction and entertainment—sometimes to the detriment of interpersonal\ninteraction.\n\nApps such as WhatsApp and Snapchat enable smart-phone users to\nremain constantly “in touch” with peers and share sources of entertainment and\ninformation.\n\nIn on-line communities such as Second Life and role-playing games such\nas World of Warcraft, people imagine an alternative existence in a virtual world.115\nSpecialized devices, such as Amazon’s Kindle have also redefined the essentials of\nlong-cherished pastimes.\n\nBooks can now be browsed and procured with a few swipes\nof the finger, stored by the thousands in a pocket-sized device, and read in much the\nsame way as a handheld paperback.\n\nTrusted platforms now exist for sharing and browsing blogs, videos, photos, and\ntopical discussions, in addition to a variety of other user-generated information.\n\nTo\noperate at the scale of the internet, these platforms must rely on techniques that are\nbeing actively developed in natural language processing, information retrieval, image\nprocessing, crowdsourcing, and machine learning.\n\nAlgorithms such as collaborative\nfiltering have been developed, for example, to recommend relevant movies, songs, or\narticles based on the user’s demographic details and browsing history .116\nTraditional sources of entertainment have also embraced AI to keep pace with the\ntimes.\n\nAs exemplified in the book and movie Moneyball , professional sport is now subjected\nto intensive quantitative analysis.117 Beyond aggregate performance statistics, on-field\nsignals can be monitored using sophisticated sensors and cameras.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 20, "char_count":

and goals among a number of organizations .\n\nA Community Profile is\ntypically developed for a particular sector , subsector, technology , threat type, or other use\ncase .\n\nAn organization can use a Community Profile as the basis for its own Target Profile .\n\nExamples of Community Profiles can be found on the NIST CSF website .\n\nThe\nsteps shown in Fig.\n\n3 and summarized below illustrate one way that an organization could\nuse an Organizational Profile to help inform continuous improvement of its cybersecurity.\n\nNIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024\n7 1.\n\nScope the Organizational Profile.\n\nDocument the high- level facts and assumptions on\nwhich the Profile will be based to define its scope .\n\nAn organization can have as many\nOrganizational Profiles as desired , each with a different scope .\n\nFor example, a Profile\ncould address an entire organization or be scoped to an organization’s financial systems\nor to countering ransomware threats and handling ransomware incidents involving\nthose financial systems.\n\n2.\n\nGather the information needed to prepare the Organizational Profile.\n\nExamples of\ninformation may include organizational policies, risk management priorities and\nresources, enterprise risk profiles, business impact analysis registers, cybersecurity\nrequirements and standards followed by the organization, practices and tools (e.g.,\nprocedures and safeguards), and work roles.\n\n3.\n\nCreate the Organizational Profile.\n\nDetermine what types of information the Profile\nshould include for the selected CSF outcomes,

basis for the Target\nProfile.\n\n4.\n\nAnalyze the gaps between the Current and Target Profiles , and create an action plan.\n\nConduct a gap analysis to i dentify and analyz e the differences between the Current and\nTarget Profiles , and develop a prioritized action plan (e.g., r isk register, risk detail report,\nPlan of Action and Milestones [POA&M]) to address those gaps.\n\n5.\n\nImplement the action plan, and update the Organizational Profile.\n\nFollow the action\nplan to address the gaps and move the organization toward the Target Profile .\n\nAn action\nplan may have an overall deadline or be ongoing.\n\nGiven the importance of continual improvement, an organization can repeat these steps as often as needed.\n\nThere are additional uses for Organizational Profiles.\n\nFor example, a Current Profile can be used\nto document and communicate the organization’s cybersecurity capabilities and known opportunities for improvement with external stakeholders , such as business partners or\nprospective customers.\n\nAlso, a Target Profile can help express the organization’s cybersecurity\nrisk management requirements and expectations to suppliers, partners, and other third parties\nas a target for those parties to achieve .\n\n3.2.\n\nCSF Tiers\nAn o rganization can choose to use the Tiers to inform its Current and Target Profil es.\n\nTiers\ncharacterize the rigor of an organization’s cybersecurity risk governance and management\npractices , and they provide context for how an organization views cybersecurity risks and the\nprocesses in place to manage those risks.\n\nThe Tiers , as shown in Fig.\n\n4 and notionally illustrated\nin Appendix B , reflect an organization’s practices for managing cybersecurity risk as Partial (Tier\n1), Risk Informed (Tier 2), Repeatable (Tier 3), and Adaptive (Tier 4).\n\nThe Tiers describe a\nprogression from informal, ad hoc responses to approaches that are agile , risk-informed , and\nNIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024\n8 continuously improving .\n\nSelecting Tiers helps set the overall tone for how an organization will\nmanage its cybersecurity risks .\n\nTiers should complement an organization’s cybersecurity risk management methodology rather\nthan replace it .\n\nFor example, an organization can use the Tiers to communicate internally as a\nbenchmark for a n organization -wide1\n1 For the purposes of this document, the terms “organization -wide” and “enterprise” have the same meaning .\n\napproach to managing cybersecurity risks .\n\nProgression to\nhigher Tiers is encouraged when risks or mandates are greater or when a cost -benefit analysis\nindicates a feasible and cost -effective reduction of negative cybersecurity risk s.\n\nThe NIST CSF

of machine -read able and human -usable formats.\n\nNIST CSWP 29 February 26, 2024\n9 4.\n\nIntroduction to Online Resources That Supplement the CSF\nNIST and other organizations have produced a suite of online resources that help organizations\nunderstand, adopt, and use the CSF .\n\nSince they are hosted online, these additional resources\ncan be updated more frequently than this document, which is updated infrequently to provide\nstability to its users, and be available in machine -readable formats.\n\nThis section provides an\noverview of three types of online resources : Informative

.\n\nAn o rganization may choose to handle risk in one\nor more ways — including mitigating , transferring, avoiding, or accepting negative risks and\nrealizing, sharing, enhancing, or accepting positive risks — depending on the potential impact s\nand likelihoods .\n\nImportantly, an organization can use the CSF both internally to manage its\ncybersecurity capabilities and externally to

wellbeing, is aggra vated by uncertainties and insecurities of all stripes:\nby major Anthropocene phenomena, such as climate\nchange; by age-old scourges of discrimination, exclu sion, conflict and violence; and by relatively newer\nentrants, such as social media and other technologies.\n\nThe uncertainties of the Anthropocene are expect ed to undermine people’s mental wellbeing through\nfour main pathways: traumatizing events, physical\nillness, general climate anxiety and food insecurity\n(see chapter in the full Report).\n\nThe effects these\nand other pathways have on children in particular\nare profound, altering brain and body development,\nespecially in families on lower social rungs, poten tially diminishing what children can achieve in life.\n\nThe 2019 Human Development Report explored how\ninequalities in human development are perpetuated\nacross generations;41 it is not difficult to see how the\nconfluence of mental distress, inequality and inse curity foment a similarly injurious intergenerational\ncycle that drags on human development.\n\n“ The uncertainties of the Anthropocene\nare expected to undermine people’s mental\nwellbeing through four main pathways:\ntraumatizing events, physical illness, general\nclimate anxiety and food insecurity\nViolence — even the threat of violence, its\nuncertainty — is a major driver of mental distress.\n\nSome survivors of and witnesses to violence suffer\ntrauma, which if not addressed properly can devel op into post-traumatic stress disorder, among other\nchronic health conditions, that can weigh heavily on\nthe choices available to them.\n\nViolence may be di rected at one person or group of people, but it affects\neverybody in its blast radius.\n\nEven perpetrators of\nviolence can suffer trauma due to the violent setting\nthat often surrounds them, as with organized crime\nor gang violence.42\nThe losses exacted by violence extend well beyond\ndirect physical, mental and emotional injury or trau ma.\n\nViolence can cause and exacerbate all kinds of\ninsecurities — food, economic and so forth — that are\nthemselves major drivers of mental distress.\n\nMany\nkinds of violence, from interpersonal violence to or ganized crime to armed conflict, perniciously under mine trust in people we know and in people we do not\nknow.\n\nBreakdowns in trust may then beget more in stability, more violence.\n\n“ Mental disorders weigh on human development\nin many ways.\n\nA health issue themselves, they are\noften linked to other health challenges.\n\nThey can\nimpede school attendance and learning, as well\nas the ability to find a job and be fully productive\nat it.\n\nThe stigma that often accompanies\nmental disorders makes matters worse\nThen there is the loss of agency due to violence.\n\nThe\ncomplex interplay of forces, rooted in asymmetries of\npower, is powerfully at work in intimate partner vio lence, whose survivors are predominately women\nand which is correlated with some measures of wom en’s economic dependence (see chapter in the full\nReport).\n\nChannels of dominance at the societal and\ninstitutional levels can take concentrated, wicked\nforms — especially for women, children and older\npeople — behind what are meant to be the safe walls\nof a home, leaving those subjected to domestic abuse\nwith either the perception or the reality of no escape.\n\nThe ensuing entrapment of people violates human\nrights, constrains agency and ultimately undercuts\nour collective ability to navigate a turbulent new era.\n\nAs it has been in so many ways, the Covid-19 pan demic is ominously illustrative.\n\nDuring the first year\nof the pandemic, the global prevalence of depres sion and anxiety increased by more than percent.43\nLow-income

China accounted for 45% of these installations, or\n86GW, and was followed by the United States, India and Brazil. The Netherlands, Germany,\nJapan, Spain, Australia and the Republic of Korea rounded out the top ten (IRENA, 2023b).\nChina is home to the vast majority of global solar PV manufacturing, supported by\ncomprehensive industrial policies. The country retains a commanding position across the supply chain, from ingots and wafers to cells and modules. Southeast Asia has become an important, but much smaller, production and export hub, whereas the rest of the world has a marginal share in the supply chain.\nEurope’s PV imports surged during the first half of 2022 due to the Ukraine crisis and\nsubsequent efforts to reduce reliance on oil and gas imports. However, installation rates trailed due to shortages of inverters and skilled labour, which subsequently slowed imports during the second half of the year. India’s module imports declined significantly after the first quarter of 2022 once its basic customs duty took effect. In Brazil, a rush of installations was triggered by an impending law imposing a grid fee on small-scale distributed projects (Chen, 2023).\nAccording to the United States (US) Department of Energy (US DOE, 2022), 1GW of\nproduction capacity (for crystalline silicon [c-Si] modules, which account for about 90% of\nall manufactured modules) could generate anywhere from 1 085 jobs to 2 020 direct jobs across the full value chain.\nIRENA estimates global solar PV employment at 4.9  million in 2022, up from about 4.3  million\nin 2021.

In the most recent report in the series A Gender Perspective , IRENA assessed the challenges faced by women working in the solar\nphotovoltaic (PV) sector. The assessment considered both modern markets and energy access scenarios. The study, the third in the series, obtained primary data from individuals and organisations in the solar PV sector by means of a global online survey (IRENA, 2022a).\nThe analysis showed that women represent 40% of the full-time positions in the\nsolar PV sector, almost twice as much as in the wind or the oil and gas sectors (21% and 22%, respectively). The solar PV sector exceeds women’s average 32% share across the broader renewable energy sector but falls somewhat short of the share of women employed in the overall economy (see Women’s representation across solar PV job roles is uneven. They are most frequently hired for administrative\npositions, where their share reaches 58%. Meanwhile, women represented comparatively small shares, 32% of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) positions and 35% of non-STEM technical positions (such as lawyers or procurement experts) . Further, women hold 38% of other non-technical positions\n(e.g. marketing, sales, distribution, product assembly or installation). The better performance in this category is\nlargely due to off-grid solar, which has multiple positions and initiatives targeting women. This may also influence leadership composition, with women accounting for 30% of managerial jobs.

This figure translates to an impressive 37% of the global total renewable energy capacity. Total installed hydropower capacity exceeds that of wind and solar PV, although annual additions are much smaller now – some 20.5GW in 2022. As shown in To assess job numbers in hydropower, IRENA uses an employment-factor approach\ncoupled with national-level data for select countries. Considering data revisions since the previous edition of the Annual Review, the latest report estimates that about 2.49  million individuals were directly employed in the sector in 2022, 2.3% more than\nin the previous year. Consistent with earlier findings, O&M represent two-thirds of the direct jobs, 30% of the jobs are related to construction and installation activities, and about 6% are in component manufacturing. The remaining fraction pertains to O&M services, which represent the smallest proportion of the workforce. China continues to dominate in hydropower employment with a 35% share of the global total.

Three million units were sold in Europe in 2022. This is 38% more than in 2021, double the sales volume in 2019 and three times as many sales as in 2016 (Rosenow and Gibb, 2023).\nBased on a survey of its members, the European Heat Pump Association estimates\nthat in 2022, about 116 000 people were employed in this growing sector in European countries (see The largest number of European heat pump jobs are found in France, Italy and Germany,\nwhich together represent just over half of the European total (Nowak and Westring, 2023). A large portion of installations centres on European-made heat pumps. This creates local jobs, although recent demand growth has surpassed local manufacturing capacities and raised reliance on imports (EurObserv’ER, 2023). Companies announced plans for investments of more than EUR 5.5 billion in new European manufacturing factories (REN21, 2023).\nIn China, the heat pump industry provided employment opportunities for a similar\nnumber of people as in Europe, some 118 000 in 2022 (CHPA, 2023).

Some 28 000 people produced equipment and 20 000 people produced components. Sales and installation services, including sales, logistics, installation, and after-sales, provided employment opportunities for 71 000 people, about 60% of the total. The China Heat Pump Alliance forecasts that the heat pump industry could provide employment opportunities for 400 000 people by 2030 in China.\nIn the United States, the Energy and Employment Report estimates 6 465  jobs related to ground-source or\ngeothermal heat pumps in 2022. The figure for air-source heat pumps is much higher, at 64 641 (US DOE, 2023).\nFollowing the COVID-19–induced activity slump in 2020 (when just 340  megawatts\n[MW] were installed), the off-grid sector rebounded, adding 690MW of new capacity in 2021 and 1 400MW in 2022 (IRENA, 2023b). Among various emerging technologies, decentralised renewable energy has emerged as a viable solution to provide reliable and clean power to communities, especially in remote areas. Beyond the environmental benefits, this decentralised approach creates local jobs and excellent opportunities for promoting diversity. This section discusses job and livelihood implications for mini-grids (often based on solar PV), small-scale hydropower and clean cooking solutions.\n1.6.1 Mini-grids\nMini-grids will play an increasingly important role in closing existing gaps in energy access, especially in remote rural areas. In 2010, there were about 500  mini-grid installations in Sub-Saharan Africa. While the number has risen significantly, to over 3 000 installations at present, further acceleration is needed. According to one estimate, more than 160 000 mini-grids are required to address access needs (World Bank, 2023).\nKenya features prominently in the region, having deployed a significant share of Africa’s\nmini-grids. The International Labour Organization has undertaken an assessment of the\nemployment impacts of the EU-funded Green Mini-Grid (GMG) Facility Programme in Kenya, which consists of 33  sites, principally solar PV based. For a typical mini-grid, the study (Oyuma, Game and Lieuw-Kie-Song, 2023) assumes that the design and feasibility phase takes one month of work and the construction phase takes another month, engaging, respectively, 7 and 104 workers. This translates into 0.7 and 8.8 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs, respectively, for a total of 9.5 FTE jobs, nearly all held by men. Most of the jobs are unskilled; almost half of the construction phase jobs pay an average daily wage of KES 500 (USD 4.69),\n5 compared with KES 1 600 (USD 15.025) for\nwiring work, and KES 2 700 (USD 25.355) for field engineers and household mappers, for example. For O&M, the study estimates an additional 2.8 FTE jobs. For the 33 sites under GMG, the study also estimated indirect and induced employment at 652 jobs (these are not necessarily FTE jobs) in agriculture, manufacturing and services. Women account for about 20% of the total.\nBased on average investment costs of EUR 195 275 per site and costs per connection of\nEUR 688, the study estimated that for every EUR 1 million invested, 58 FTE jobs could be created annually. Table 1 summarises key findings pertaining to direct jobs at present and direct jobs if future mini-grid targets are realised.\nEDITIONth5 Average exchange rate of USD 1 = KES 106.488 in 2020, when the study was conducted.

They not\nonly provide electricity but could also support irrigation services and connect communities to the central grid. They also make it possible to sell excess power, creating opportunities for additional income generation. In this way, they help transform local economies and generate inclusive growth by empowering rural women to participate in these activities. Further, community-based hydro mini-grids incentivise local communities to restore and maintain surrounding watersheds, contributing to environmental sustainability.\nThe implementation value chain of small-scale hydropower offers plenty of local job opportunities. Jobs can be\ncreated due to feasibility studies, planning and procurement, and equipment manufacturing, to installation and connection, O&M, and eventually, decommissioning.\nAccording to IRENA’s latest Leveraging local capacity analysis (IRENA, 2023c), a small-scale hydropower plant\nrequires substantial labour to implement. For instance, a pico hydro plant (averaging 5kW)\nrequires over 17 000  person-days, a micro hydro facility (50kW) requires approximately 64 000 person-days and a mini hydro system (500kW) requires more than 160 000 person-days.\n6 Among all value chain segments for a system, the majority of labour is needed for\nO&M work over the system’s lifetime. This O&M work accounts for 94%, 87% and 78% of total person-days for pico, micro and mini hydro, respectively (see EDITIONthmicro and mini hydro plants\n6 Person-days reflect the amount of work done by one person working full-time for one day.", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 6, "char_count": 2240, "token_estimate": 518, "word_count": 319, "has_header": true, "header_text": "Chapter", "header_level": 2, "parent_sections": [], "contains_list": false, "contains_numbered_list": false, "contains_quote": false, "contains_code": false, "embedding_ready": true, "total_chunks_in_doc": 9, "prev_chunk_id": "renewable_energy_jobs_chunk_005", "next_chunk_id": "renewable_energy_jobs_chunk_007"}}

However, translating energy access into livelihood improvements requires investing in a social ecosystem that fosters technology solutions tailored to the specific needs of local communities. This investment should include financing, capacity and skill training, market access and cross-sector policy support to fully realise the benefits of decentralised renewable energy solutions.\nThe hardware required for small-scale hydropower can be manufactured locally. This creates opportunities for local skill building and fostering enterprise development. However, costly international standards often hinder local developers from competing for projects. Donor-funded international programmes must encourage the involvement of local experts instead of relying solely on foreign service providers. Full realisation of small-scale hydropower’s benefits and maximum domestic value creation require policies and measures to prioritise community capacity enhancement along the value chain and the promotion of social acceptance.\nAs the sector continues to grow, the demand for skilled workers in installation, maintenance, entrepreneurship\nand community engagement will increase. The expansion of the decentralised renewable energy job market has a positive multiplier effect, benefiting local economies, reducing poverty and fostering social development.\nNon-STEM Low and mid skills STEM Administrative93%2.4% 4%0.3% 0.3%\n4% 8%2%\n12% 7%\n88% 79%\n500kW\n50kW5kW\nAchieving universal access to clean cooking solutions is a pressing global challenge.\nTraditional cooking methods, such as open fires and inefficient stoves, not only contribute to indoor air pollution but also have severe health, environmental and socio-economic implications. Renewables-based clean cooking solutions, including bioethanol-based, biogas-based, electricity-driven and modern biomass-based solutions, present a significant opportunity to accelerate progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 7 and offer substantial job opportunities.\nStudies show that countries such as Kenya had about 700 FTE jobs in the bioethanol\nsector in 2019, while the biogas sector employed 800  people and the electric cooking sector employed 200 (Lee et al. , 2021). The potential for an increase in jobs numbers in\nthe clean cooking sector is substantial if renewable-based solutions were to replace liquid petroleum gas. Currently, the sector, including liquid petroleum gas, is estimated to provide approximately 19 000 direct, formal jobs. There is also potential for 15 000–35 000 direct but informal jobs. Viet Nam’s biogas programme deployed over 180 000 biodigesters between 2003 and 2020, creating 2 500 jobs in the construction and services sectors (SNV and EnDev, 2021). Training and skill development is a critical element of local job creation in the clean cooking sector, which involves manufacturers, installers and O&M providers, as well as smallholder farmers where feedstock is needed ( e.g. bioethanol supply chains)\n(IRENA, 2023d).\nLee et al. (2021) also showed that women’s involvement in the sector is limited, representing\nonly about 20% of the non-managerial workforce, due to the physically demanding nature\nof these jobs. However, there are more women managers in the clean cooking sector. For biogas-based solutions, about one-third of managers are women, a share that rises to one-half for bioethanol-based and electricity-powered cooking solutions. According to the study, companies typically express a strong desire to involve women in managerial roles and in the research and development of products. The clean cooking sector thus presents a unique opportunity to bridge both the skill and gender gap (Lee et al. , 2021).\nEDITIONth", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 7, "char_count": 4239, "token_estimate": 832, "word_count": 595, "has_header": true, "header_text": "Chapter", "header_level": 2, "parent_sections": [], "contains_list": false, "contains_numbered_list": false, "contains_quote": false, "contains_code": false, "embedding_ready": true, "total_chunks_in_doc": 9, "prev_chunk_id": "renewable_energy_jobs_chunk_006", "next_chunk_id": "renewable_energy_jobs_chunk_008"}}

Further, the development of grid transmission and distribution networks will be crucial in unfolding the energy transition, as is true for flexibility innovations, energy storage and hydrogen technologies, among others.\nThe shift towards sustainable energy sources fosters increased economic engagement\nand redirects financial endeavours from fossil fuels towards sectors involved in the energy transition. IRENA’s World Energy Transitions Outlook presents a 1.5°C-compatible trajectory that is consistent with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The macroeconometric modelling framework underlying IRENA’s 1.5°C pathway captures the effects of and feedback loops for different climate and energy transition policies, including their impacts on government revenue streams, spending, and distributional and social impacts. The 2022 edition of the Outlook indicated that if the world follows\nIRENA’s 1.5°C pathway, employment in the energy sector could grow to 139  million jobs by 2030, with renewables accounting for 38.2 million and other energy transition technologies for 74.2 million (IRENA, 2022b) .\nThese numbers are derived from socio-economic modelling of IRENA’s 1.5°C scenario, which represents a complex set of investments and policies that can drive the needed change in the energy sector. However, IRENA’s work has consistently emphasised that the transition has socio-economic effects (GDP, employment, and social welfare) far beyond the energy sector, across the economy at large. These impacts are shaped by an array of policies, and it is critical that outcomes maximise benefits for people while minimising uncertainties and adjustment burdens. Some of the key policies include carbon pricing, fossil fuel subsidy reduction, higher government spending on social infrastructures, and international collaboration. The forthcoming volume 2 of World Energy Transitions Outlook 2023 , also explores the impacts of channeling revenues from wealth taxes towards social\ninvestments, and presents the impact of fair wages to workers in mineral mining industries in developing or emerging economies (IRENA 2023a, forthcoming).\ngovernments need to proactively establish robust policies to foster the widespread implementation and seamless integration of renewable technologies. Prioritising the cultivation of a skilled workforce remains imperative, alongside a growing emphasis on the calibre of these employment positions. Further, it is critical that policy makers conceive an overarching framework that encompasses a spectrum of measures, including industrial strategies, labour market policies, social safety nets and initiates for promoting diversity and inclusivity (see Section 4).\nMoreover, the landscape of labour is undergoing a paradigm shift as automation increases\nin the manufacturing sector. This transformation is recalibrating employment dynamics, reducing traditional workforce dependencies while simultaneously generating demand for the skill sets required to program and operate automated systems. While this transition might entail job displacements, the positions that emerge from it are anticipated to be of higher quality, demanding advanced skills. Ensuring low-income individuals' access to these roles should be a top priority.\nMeeting the human resource capacity challenge to fill these energy-transition-related\nroles requires a robust scaling up of education and training programmes. It also calls for strategic measures to cultivate an inclusive and gender-balanced transition workforce. By embracing these multi-faceted approaches, the energy transition can accelerate the move to a more equitable and empowered workforce.\nEDITIONth", "metadata": {"chunk_index": 8, "char_count": 4069, "token_estimate": 735, "word_count": 562, "has_header": true, "header_text": "Chapter", "header_level": 2, "parent_sections": [], "contains_list": false, "contains_numbered_list": false, "contains_quote": false, "contains_code": false, "embedding_ready": true, "total_chunks_in_doc": 9, "prev_chunk_id": "renewable_energy_jobs_chunk_007", "next_chunk_id": null}}
