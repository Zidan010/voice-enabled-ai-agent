## Cybersecurity

Given the complex and interconnected relationships in this ecosystem , supply chain risk
management is critical for organizations.

Cybersecurity SCRM (C- SCRM) is a
systematic process for managing exposure to cybersecurity risk throughout supply
chain s and developing appropriate response strategies, policies, processes, and
procedures.

The Subcategories within the CSF C-SCRM Category [GV.SC] provide a
connection between outcomes that f ocus purely on cybersecurity and those that focus

Practices for Systems and Organizations , p rovides in -depth information on C -SCRM.

- Risks from emerging technologies: As new technologies and new applications of
technology become available, new risks become clear.

A contemporary example is
artificial intelligence ( AI), which has cybersecurity and privacy risks, as well as many
other types of risk.

The NIST Artificial Intelligence Risk Management Framework (AI
RMF) w as developed to help address the se risks.

Treating AI risks along side other
enterprise risks (e.g., financial, cybersecurity, reputational, and privacy ) will yield a more
integrated outcome and organizational efficiencies.

Cybersecurity and privacy risk management considerations and approaches are applicable to the design, development,
deployment, evaluation, and use of AI systems.

The AI RMF Core uses Fu nctions,
Categories, and Subcategories to describe AI outcomes and help manage risks related to
AI.
