## Guiding Principles

The four guiding principles aim to orient the global strategy towards the
appropriate and sustainable adoption of digital health technologies within
the context of national health sector and health strategies.16Promote the appropriate use of digital technologies for health
The global strategy promotes the appropriate use of digital
technologies as digital public goods which are adaptable to different
countries and contexts to help address key health system challenges
to support equity in access to digital resources so that no one is
left behind. It promotes the protection of people, populations,
health care professionals and systems against misinformation and
the misuse of information, malicious cyber activities, fraud and
exploitation, inappropriate use of health data, racism and human
rights violations within the framework established by international
treaties binding the Member States.
The “digital determinants of health” , such as literacy in information
and communication technologies and access to equipment,
broadband and the internet, become more important as digital
health becomes more prevalent. The global strategy underscores the
need to ground digital foundations within national strategies and
emphasizes the need to work with different sectors and stakeholders
at all levels.
The global strategy promotes syntactic and semantic interoperability
with WHO norms and standards as a cornerstone of health
information to enable sharing of information in a connected world.
The appropriate use of digital health takes the following dimensions
into consideration: health promotion and disease prevention, patient
safety, ethics, interoperability, intellectual property, data security
(confidentiality, integrity, and availability), privacy, cost-effectiveness,
patient engagement, and affordability. It should be people-centred,
trust-based, evidence-based, effective, efficient, sustainable,
inclusive, equitable and contextualized. The growing global challenge
of digital waste on health and the environment must also be
appropriately managed.3
17Recognize the urgent need to address the major impediments
faced by least-developed countries implementing digital
health technologies
There is a pressing need to invest in efforts to overcome the major
impediments that developing countries face in engaging with and
accessing new digital health technologies, such as an appropriate
enabling environment, sufficient resources, infrastructure to support
the digital transformation, education, human capacity, financial
investment and internet connectivity, as well as issues related to
legacy infrastructure, technology ownership, privacy, security, and
adapting and implementing global standards and technology flows.4
knowledge on digital health
This strategic objective aims to align countries and stakeholders to
collectively act upon global opportunities to improve health and
work towards universal health coverage, while meeting challenges,
identifying and communicating risks, and focusing on threats
associated with the use of digital technologies both to improve health
and to enable universal health coverage, the core of the healthrelated Sustainable Development Goals. This objective encourages
action on common opportunities and challenges that are relevant to
all countries and stakeholders, regardless of their situation.
Maximize the impact of both new and existing collaborations and
partnerships in the wider digital health ecosystem. Knowledge of and
investments in digital health design and implementation are shared
across domains; hence this strategic objective aims to maximize
collaborations and partnerships with other agencies within the
United Nations system, countries and other stakeholders and to help
to build new ones.
Assess and promote the latest, appropriate and innovative health
technologies. Pioneering health technologies are creating new and
advanced health care services and solutions. This sub-objective
helps to ensure that the quality and outcome of the new health
technologies are assessed in order to enable their timely adoption
and promotion. Norms, standards, policies and regulations are
needed to ensure the investment, sustainability, quality, security
and safety of both digital health products and cutting-edge health
technologies that not only are used in health care but that may also
be directly marketed to individuals. Global guidance, coordination
