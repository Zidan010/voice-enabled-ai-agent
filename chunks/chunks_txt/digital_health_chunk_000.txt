## Digital Health

13globally and within countries at national and subnational levels,
that will contribute to building an internationally connected digital
health system with consideration of potential risks. It aims to
encourage international collaboration and to support countries in
their national programmes towards improved health care service
delivery, implementing national health strategies, promoting research
and development and working towards achieving universal health
coverage and the health-related Sustainable Development Goals.
The global strategy will lead to concrete actions and results within the
time frame from 2020 to 2025.Global strategy on digital health 2020-2025 PURPOSE
15Acknowledge that institutionalization of digital health in the
national health system requires a decision and commitment
by countries
The global strategy acknowledges that each country owns its digital
health action plan built on the strategy, within its own national
context. Along their path towards the health-related Sustainable
Development Goals, countries will adopt digital health in a way that
is sustainable, respects their sovereignty, and best suits their culture
and values, national health policy, vision, goals, health and well-being
needs, and available resources.
Recognize that successful digital health initiatives require an
integrated strategy
Digital technologies are an essential component and an enabler
of sustainable health systems and universal health coverage. To
realize their potential, digital health initiatives must be part of the
wider health needs and the digital health ecosystem and guided by
a robust strategy that integrates leadership, financial, organizational,
human and technological resources and is used as the basis for a
costed action plan which enables coordination among multiple
stakeholders. These initiatives should be led through strong
governance structures. The strategy should address an approach that
will work across multiple health priorities underpinned by standards
and an architecture that enables this integration.
Historical review shows that ill-coordinated or disjoined digital
health initiatives lead to vertical or stand- alone information and
communications technology solutions that, although well-intended,
often result in information fragmentation and, consequently, poor
delivery of services.
