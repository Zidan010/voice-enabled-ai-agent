## INTELLIGENCE?

In the coming years, new perception/object
recognition capabilities and robotic platforms that are human-safe will grow, as will
data-driven products and their markets.

The Study Panel also expects a reemergence of some of the traditional forms of
AI as practitioners come to realize the inevitable limitations of purely end-to-end deep
learning approaches.

We encourage young researchers not to reinvent the wheel,
but rather to maintain an awareness of the significant progress in many areas of
AI during the first fifty years of the field, and in related fields such as control theory ,
cognitive science, and psychology .A growing body of research
is devoted to the idea that
a wide array of devices
can be interconnected
to collect and share their
sensory information.

Such devices can include
appliances, vehicles,
buildings, cameras, and
other things.

# Though different instances of AI research and practice share common technologies, such

as machine learning, they also vary considerably in different sectors of the economy and
society.

We call these sectors “domains,” and in this section describe the different states
of AI research and implementation, as well as impacts and distinct challenges, in eight of
them: transportation; home/service robotics; healthcare; education; low-resource communities;
public safety and security; employment and workplace; and entertainment.

Based on these
analyses, we also predict trends in a typical North American city over the next fifteen years.

Contrary to AI’s typical depiction in popular culture, we seek to offer a balanced overview
of the ways in which AI is already beginning to transform everyday life, and how those
transformations are likely to grow by the year 2030.

TRANSPORTATION
Transportation is likely to be one of the first domains in which the general public
will be asked to trust the reliability and safety of an AI system for a critical task.

Autonomous transportation will soon be commonplace and, as most people’s first
experience with physically embodied AI systems, will strongly influence the public’s
perception of AI.

Once the physical hardware is made sufficiently safe and robust, its
introduction to daily life may happen so suddenly as to surprise the public, which will
require time to adjust.

As cars will become better drivers than people, city-dwellers
will own fewer cars, live further from work, and spend time differently , leading to an
entirely new urban organization.

Further, in the typical North American city in 2030,
changes won’t be limited to cars and trucks, but are likely to include flying vehicles
and personal robots, and will raise social, ethical and policy issues.

A few key technologies have already catalyzed the widespread adoption of AI
in transportation.

Compared to 2000, the scale and diversity of data about personal
and population-level transportation available today—enabled by the adoption of
smartphones and decreased costs and improved accuracies for variety of sensors—is
astounding.

Without the availability of this data and connectivity , applications such as
real-time sensing and prediction of traffic, route calculations, peer-to-peer ridesharing
and self-driving cars would not be possible.

Smarter cars
GPS was introduced to personal vehicles in with in-car navigation devices and
has since become a fundamental part of the transportation infrastructure.19 GPS
assists drivers while providing large-scale information to technology companies and
cities about transportation patterns.

Widespread adoption of smartphones with GPS
technology further increased connectivity and the amount of location data shared by
individuals.

Current vehicles are also equipped with a wide range of sensing capabilities.

An average automobile in the US is predicted to have seventy sensors including
gyroscopes, accelerometers, ambient light sensors, and moisture sensors.20 Sensors
are not new to vehicles.

Automobiles built before had sensors for the
internal state of the vehicle such as its speed, acceleration, and wheel position.21 Mark Sullivan, “ A brief history of GPS,” PCWorld , August 9, 2012, .

transportation will soon
be commonplace and,
as most people’s first
experience with physically
embodied AI systems,
will strongly influence the
public’s perception of AI.

19They already had a number of functionalities that combined real-time sensing with
perception and decision-making such as Anti-lock Braking Systems (ABS), airbag
control, Traction Control Systems (TCS), and Electronic Stability Control (ESC).22
Automated capabilities have been introduced into commercial cars gradually since as summarized in the following table.

Context Automated Functionality Release Date
Parking Intelligent Parking Assist System Since Parking Summon Since Arterial & Highway Lane departure system Since in North America25
Arterial & Highway Adaptive cruise control Since in North America26
Highway Blind spot monitoring Highway Lane changing These functionalities assist drivers or completely take over well-defined activities
for increased safety and comfort.

Current cars can park themselves, perform adaptive
cruise control on highways, steer themselves during stop-and-go traffic, and alert
drivers about objects in blind spots during lane changes.

Vision and radar technology
were leveraged to develop pre-collision systems that let cars autonomously brake
when risk of a collision is detected.

Deep learning also has been applied to improve
automobiles’ capacity to detect objects in the environment and recognize sound .29
Self-driving vehicles
Since the 1930s, science fiction writers dreamed of a future with self-driving cars,
and building them has been a challenge for the AI community since the 1960s.
