## 22To strengthen health systems by introducing digital technologies,

a key objective is to find ways to build capacity and create a
digitally-capable health workforce. Needs will vary from country to
country, but they often include basic capacities, such as leadership
and governance, and the development of a skilled health and
technological workforce.
Policy options and actions
The following policy options and actions are proposed:
- stimulate and support every country to adopt or review, own,
and strengthen its national digital health strategy in a way that
enhances the level of country maturity regarding digital health to
achieve positive health outcomes in line with the national health
plans, updated norms and standards recommendations, and
universal health coverage;
- ensure that institutions, decision-makers and personnel
involved in the provision of health care services and all enduser communities and beneficiary populations are adequately
engaged in the design and development phases;
- facilitate a systematic engagement of all relevant stakeholders in
the realization of the vision and its strategic objectives as part of
an integrated digital health ecosystem at the national level;
- define a national digital health architecture blueprint or road
map, adopt open-source health data standards and aim for
reusable systems or assets including interoperability of health
information systems both at national and international levels in
order to establish an innovative integration of different digital
technologies using shared services, ensuring data are of good
and comparable quality;
- adopt legal and ethical frameworks for assuring patient safety,
data security, appropriate use and ownership of health data,
privacy data recoverability, as well as protection of intellectual
property rights;
- identify and promote sustainable financing models in
support of digital health development and sharing of learning
to inform future products and services. This is especially
important in artificial intelligence including machine learning,
implementation, integration and maintenance, including
economic incentives; and
- design, implement and monitor a change management plan, to
support conducive organizational behaviour surrounding newly
digitized health processes and practices.
Outputs
The following outputs are envisaged:
- a national digital health strategy or equivalent strategic
framework exists, is integrated in the national health strategy
and is actively used to guide development and accelerate
progress towards the health-related targets of the Sustainable
Development Goals and in the context of digital transformation of
health systems; and
- a dynamic digital health maturity model assessment to guide
prioritization of national investment in digital health is made in
support of primary health care and universal health coverage.
Strengthen governance for digital health at global, regional and
national levels
This strategic objective focuses on strengthening the governance of
digital health at national and international levels through the creation
of sustainable and robust governance structures and building the
capacity for digital health at global and national levels. Governance
for digital health aims to strengthen the capabilities and skills
needed for countries to promote, innovate and scale up digital
health technologies.
The strategic objective promotes standards for safety, security,
privacy, interoperability, and the ethical use of data within and
outside the health sector. Actions to strengthen governance Digital health governance
