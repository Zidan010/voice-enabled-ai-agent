## 24should include defining principles and reaching cross-sectoral and

international agreements for data sharing, quality and accuracy
of health data and prioritization of investment plans and policy. It
should also include principles for the ethical use of health data in
technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data analytics.
It also aims to improve measurement and monitoring of and research
on the application of digital health in the health sector. The research
agenda should meet the need to improve and disseminate evidence
and information on the use of digital health at all levels. Research on
and evaluation of digital health outcomes and impact are essential
to support its safe implementation, to establish and promote
accountability and to justify the financial investment. The agenda
should also address the need to stimulate the development and
testing of technologies, methods and infrastructures that overcome
obstacles to the application of digital health to health priorities. This
agenda is closely linked to capacity-building of research teams and
the improvement and sharing of methods and data analytics.
Policy options and actions
The following policy options and actions are proposed:
- strengthen governance of digital health at national and
international levels by leveraging existing structures and as
appropriate creating sustainable and robust governance
structures, including regulatory frameworks, and the capacity for
the implementation of evidence-based and proven digital health
solutions at global and national levels;
- coordinate investments in evidence-based approaches to
assess promote and disseminate new and innovative health
technologies for national scaled digital health programmes using
a person-centred approach to facilitate actions and investments
based on informed decisions;
- promote and facilitate digital health competencies in the
education and training curricula of all health professionals and
allied workers; and 254) promote capacity-building for leaders of public health
authorities, affiliated agencies and policy-makers to take
informed decisions to support digital health investments.
Outputs
The following outputs are envisaged:
- governance exists, in accordance with Secretariat-led
development of regulatory framework, to agree on global
appropriate use of health data and on concepts such as health
data as a global public good and to outline principles of equitable
data-sharing principles for research, consistent metadata and
definitions, artificial intelligence and data analytics, and primary
and secondary use of data;
- a voluntary guideline on global interoperability standards for
digital health is developed in collaboration with stakeholders
and adopted, that a) tries to build upon results already broadly
achieved, b) includes a list of commonly agreed use cases for the
public health care sector, its functional requirements and a set
of functional and technical specifications, standards, semantics
and profiles derived thereof, c) defines requirements for a sound
legal and regulatory framework with clearly defined roles for data
governance and d) encompasses political leadership regarding
public investment, procurement and standardization to create
an interoperable digital health ecosystem at the national and
international levels;
- global guidance on planning, development and use of digital
hospitals, digital clinical trials and digital therapeutics is
developed; and
- a set of recommendations is developed for pseudonymization
and anonymization of health data.26Advocate people-centred health systems that are enabled by
digital health
This strategic objective advances digital health literacy, gender
equality and women’ s empowerment and inclusive approaches to
adoption and management of digital health technologies.
The strategic objective places people at the centre of digital health
through the adoption and use of digital health technologies in scaling
up and strengthening health service delivery. The individual is an
essential component in the delivery of trust-based, people-centred
care. This focus covers not only patients, families and communities
but also the health workers who need to be prepared to deploy or
use digital health technologies in their work. Planning for capacitybuilding includes workforce assessment, ranging from professionals
in information and communication technologies to health workers
providing care services. Being intrinsically multidisciplinary and
interdisciplinary, capacity-building entails instilling capabilities,
attitudes and skills which may range from computer sciences,
strategic planning, finance and management to health sciences
and care delivery, depending on the digital health application and
its context. Assessment of the workforce should also consider the
implications for the health labour market of introducing digital
technologies and their management. This objective would call for
countries to move away from the current disease focused systems to
an integrated approach with the patient at the centre.
Attitudes to, practices in and public awareness of digital health
should also be addressed. Possible actions include improving digital
health literacy at the population level, engagement of patients,
families and communities, and education of patients about health.
Better responding to the social and commercial determinants of
health to improve digital health-enabled health systems will need the
engagement of civil society but also non-health sectors and actors.
Increasing awareness of evidence based self-management tools and
increasing access to these is a further action to consider.Human-centre d health systems
