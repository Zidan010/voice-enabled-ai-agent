## 27Policy options and actions

The following policy options and actions are proposed:
- place people at the centre of digital health through the
appropriate health data ownership, adoption and use of digital
health technologies and development of appropriate literacy; the
focus will cover not only patients, families and communities but
also health workers;
- develop approaches to the management of health at the
population level through digital health applications that move
health and well-being from reactive-care models to active
community-based models, and reduce the burden of data
collection from front-line workers by reorienting reporting-based
tools into service delivery tools;
- establish monitoring and evaluation models to facilitate
monitoring the contribution of digital systems to health system
processes, health workforce processes, and individual and
community health needs;
- strengthen gender equality and health equity approaches and
accessibility for people with disabilities to promote inclusive
digital society with enhanced digital health skills. When planning
and prioritizing digital health interventions, relevant factors
of inequality should be assessed in order to ensure that the
introduction of digital health technologies does not aggravate
these ( “do no harm” ) and that access for specific population
groups is guaranteed. In addition, the specific potential of digital
technologies to promote health equity should be leveraged.
Designed properly, digital solutions can propel inclusiveness as
digital connectivity can transcend physical barriers;
- implement mechanisms for more effective public participation
and transparency in national and international digital health
decision-making processes, such as through international
consultation processes or a stakeholder forum;
- develop digital health training or Massive Open Online Courses to
improve digital health literacy; and
