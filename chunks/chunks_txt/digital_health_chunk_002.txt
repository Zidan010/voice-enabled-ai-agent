## Strategic Objectives

The four strategic objectives are intended to provide guidance and
coordination on global digital health transformation and to strengthen
synergies between initiatives and stakeholders to improve health
outcomes and mitigate associated risks at all levels.

## Collaboration and knowledge transfer

20Policy options and actions
The following policy options and actions are proposed:
- co-create the global strategy on digital health and establish
mechanisms for strengthening national digital health strategies
and implementing key collaborations on agreed-upon
appropriate use of digital technologies to achieve national health
and well-being goals;
- establish a knowledge management approach to identify and
share good practices, knowledge about implementation of new
methods and techniques, evidence and lessons learned on digital
health across countries and international communities;
- support countries in establishing information centres for disease
surveillance to manage and implement timely decisions during
epidemics and other public health emergencies;
- align countries and stakeholders to address collectively global,
regional and national challenges and opportunities; identify,
manage and communicate risks; and mitigate threats associated
with the use of digital technologies to improve health and
enable universal health coverage, the core of the health- related
Sustainable Development Goals.
Outputs
The following outputs are envisaged:
- digital health is prioritized and integrated into health systems at
global, regional and national levels through dedicated bodies
and mechanisms for governance;
- multistakeholder groups are convened on a regular
basis to support the appropriate use and scaling up of digital
health and innovation in order to accelerate progress towards the
health-related Sustainable Development Goals; and implementation of tools are required for their adoption and
integration into existing systems and services at the national level.
- information centres for disease surveillance are established or
strengthened at national, regional and global levels.
Advance the implementation of national digital health
strategies
Strategic objective 2 aims to stimulate and support every country to
own, adapt and strengthen its strategy on digital health in a way that
best suits its vision, national context, health situation and trends,
available resources and core values.
Strategic objective 2 encourages the development of a national
strategy on digital health through an all- inclusive multistakeholder
approach including actors collaborating within communities of
practice and with consideration to the following core components:
(1) leadership and governance; (2) investment and operations;
(3) services and applications for scaling up (4) integration and
sustainability, while (5) standards and interoperability are respected;
(6) a flexible digital infrastructure; (7) an adaptable health workforce
and (8) legislation, ethics policies and compliance; and (9) a peoplecentred approach. These should all be developed while the necessary
alignment of country stakeholders is ensured in order that the needs
and expectations with given resources be met.
The strategic objective aims to develop cross-sectoral partnerships
at national level to align resources and investments to ensure the
sustainability and growth of digital health. The objective also seeks to
work with existing digital health partnerships to advance global digital
health efforts. Developing national partnerships for the sustainability
of digital health advances would accelerate their adoption by
Member States.
Although each country is expected to review or develop and own its
strategy from inception to implementation, this strategic objective
aims to build human and institutional capacity for the safe and
appropriate use and scale-up of digital health by strengthening the
commitment and systematic engagement of all stakeholders in
every country. The objective underpins the promotion of innovative
integration of digital technologies into health systems.Digital strategy implementation
